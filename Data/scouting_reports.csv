Victor Wembanyama,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Ralph Sampson
Strengths:
A generational talent … The sky is the limit and the reality… Has rare potential for a center in today’s NBA … Amazing size for his position with unprecedented length, including a wingspan measured at 8′ feet… Remarkable coordination for a player of his size, length and age… Surprisingly agile and fluid for a human being his size … A jaw dropping physical specimen athlete with hand eye coordination and dexterity … Runs the floor like a deer… Has long strides and covers a lot of ground and finishes plays with solid body control … Has bulked up the last couple of years, body shows that he can add muscle easily without losing mobility and agility … Good basketball I.Q… Versatile player, can be used in either front court position… Makes at least a few “WOW” plays on both ends of the floor in every game… He is a walking mismatch … Good, strong dunker, likes to dunk everything and his length makes him very hard to stop around the rim … Has also some finesse in his game … Has a perimeter player’s game in a center’s body… Moves well without the ball… Very good ball handler for a player of his size … Can put the ball on the floor and attack closeouts … Fluid and smooth shooting mechanics both in spot up and off the dribble situations … Can shoot over just about everyone thanks to his size, length and high shooting release… Good – and improving – in spot up situations… A real threat in the Pick and Pop … Has been used in off screen situations (taking a pin down or a stagger screen) with encouraging results … Can be the passer in handoffs, but he can also be on the receiving end in handoffs and shoot immediately … Willing screener on and off the ball … Improving in Pick and Roll situations as the screener … He is a point guard’s dream as a lob catcher, having the ability to reach highs that few players can … Has good footwork in the post, with a turnaround jumper in his arsenal, where he turns on his right shoulder … Can turn from either shoulder when posting up, but has a preference turning to his right shoulder… An above average passer… Has some moments where he has shown potential as a passer… Very good in transition, fills the lanes… Can even start the break after his own rebound thanks to his ball handling … The epitome of a rim protector … Good shot blocker… Alters a lot of defensive possessions thanks to his size and athleticism … Fills the passing lanes and makes steals … Has active hands on defense … Can come from the weakside and block shots … Good lateral quickness and nice mobility in his hips help him when he switches on perimeter players … A good Pick and Roll defender when his team decides to play flat, soft hedge or under… Good help defender… Am above average defensive rebounder… Very good offensive rebounder…
Weaknesses:
He has bulked up considerably, but he still needs to add some muscle to his frame… On the other hand, bulking up too much could add strain to his lower extremities, and a case could be made that his long term basketball health will benefit from staying fairly lean … His huge body, considering past players with his size and the health of all large bigmen, will always be a concern and curtails his ceiling to an extent … Already has had three minor injuries that resulted in him missing playing time and sitting out a number of weeks (a fracture in his fibula, a fracture in one of his fingers and a shoulder contusion)… Has to add strength to his torso without losing mobility… As impressive as his long term ceiling is, the center position has been downgraded with just a small handful of impactful ones in today’s NBA (AD, Jokic, Embiid, and Gobert) … Should improve his stamina so that he can be effective in bigger stretches… Can disappear from time to time and not be that engaged on offense because he doesn’t fully understand yet how to control and maintain his energy… He is a bit of a streaky shooter at this stage… Inconsistent free throw shooter over the past few seasons … Has problems against strong, physical opponents who can get under him and move him away from the basket… His high center of gravity prevents him from establishing position in the post at this point … Strong opponents with size can front him in the post and not let him receive the ball … Can become more assertive getting to the rim. Rarely forces his way to the basket in post ups… Can be prone to forcing up off balance shots against physical opponents … He faces up and settles for mid-range shots more often than he should against mismatches in the post … He has a tendency to turn predominantly to his right shoulder when posting up, which makes him predictable … Should add some moves when posting up, like an up and under … Rarely passes when he is posting up, doesn’t really read quick double teams… Catch and drive game needs some work… Should improve as a passer on the move… He doesn’t always roll hard to the basket in Pick and Roll actions as the screener… At times he tries to do too much and commits turnovers… Has to improve his upper body so that he can absorb contact at the rim better… Doesn’t draw as many fouls as someone would think for a player with his skillset and size… Telegraphs passes at time… He could add a Short Roll to his arsenal after he sets his screens so he could add more options to his game either as a passer, or as a shooter… Doesn’t always box out on defense and depends on his length… Has the tendency to jump to fakes… Foul prone, can commit one or two bad fouls in a game… Can be too focused on the ball while defending on the weakside and lose track of his man … At times he is too far away from his match up, which can cause him problems when defending stretch bigs… Bulky, physical post players can create problems for him …
Outlook:
Victor Wembanyama is probably the most hyped teenager since LeBron James… The secret about him was out way before he became eligible for the 2023 NBA Draft and blew up for 37 points including 7 three pointers against G-League Ignite… The French prospect is a generational talent with huge potential to be impactful from the center position … Scouts who are old enough will inevitably compare him with Ralph Sampson, one of the most unique players in NBA history … Wembanyama is a 7-4 giant who can handle the ball like a perimeter player, with fluid shooting mechanics, good Pick n’ Roll and Pick n’ Pop concepts, who can either Post Up or Face Up the basket and can also protect the rim and hold his ground on the perimeter is he has too… He definitely possesses flaws… His thin frame and injury history are the most glaring concerns… With that said, it’s almost impossible to not think the player that he can be… If Wembanyama stays healthy, then the sky’s the limit for him …
Stefanos Makris 10/14/22 Wembanyamania hit its peak with a pair of exhilarating October performances against the Ignite. The 7-foot-4 super prospect posted 73 points in 70 minutes with a breathtaking display of shot-making, ballhandling, shot-blocking and passing unlike anything we've ever seen before.  Wembanyama hasn't missed a beat since returning to France. He is producing steadily, as his Metropolitans 92 team has won four straight games (6-1 overall) and is second in the LNB Pro A, proving his extraordinary talent translates to winning, something that is rare for an 18-year-old at this level of competition. Wembanyama isn't only leading his team, he is emerging as the most productive player in the entire league, ranking second in scoring, third in rebounding, first in blocks and fifth in usage rate.  Unsurprisingly, Wembanyama is playing a different style of basketball in France than what scouts saw against the Ignite in Las Vegas, something his coach, Vincent Collet, said is expected considering the shorter 3-point line and increased physicality of the European game.  ""Defense is different [in the United States],"" Collet said. ""He has more room in the G League game. And probably the referees are protecting more. Sometimes they grab him in France [making a bear hug motion with arms]. So that's something special that didn't happen [in Las Vegas]. I don't think he has to play to make seven 3s each game.""  Towering over opponents, we've seen Wembanyama look more assertive, utilizing his size and physicality operating with his back to the basket, where he shows an extremely high skill level and is big enough to simply shoot over virtually any defender with unstoppable turnaround jumpers. While Wembanyama's perimeter shooting, fluidity pushing off the defensive glass and handling in pick-and-roll and isolation situations generate some of his most notable highlights, the footwork, fluidity, dexterity and touch he shows in the post also is encouraging considering his propensity to shy away from contact in the past.  Wembanyama still drops glimpses of the same incredible talent he displayed in Las Vegas, having the freedom to push the ball the length of the floor, reject ball screens or shoot coming off pindowns or one-legged jumpers -- things that are unheard of and simply mesmerizing for a player his size. He hasn't been quite as consistent with his outside shot -- 11-for-33 from 3 in France as compared to 9-for-18 against the Ignite -- but part of that is due to difficult attempts, the amount of defensive attention he draws every game and some regression to the mean after a scorching 7 for 11 performance in one of the Ignite games in Vegas.  Defensively, Wembanyama is similarly a game-changer, anchoring the French league's stingiest defense (101.4 points per 100 possessions). Though his presence alone deters opposing teams from challenging him in the paint, he still leads the league in blocks.  His 8-foot wingspan not only protects the rim, it allows him to recover when he is beat off the perimeter. He is intelligent defending ball screens, exhibits impressive poise and patience staying on his feet and avoids silly fouls, showing great hands swiping down for deflections and steals, which is part of the reason his team leads the league in turnovers generated.  The one area scouts want to see him improve is with his physicality on the defensive glass, where he still gets pushed around. Still, it's difficult not to be impressed by how much he has upgraded his intensity level from years past.  Next for Wembanyama will be a fascinating change of jerseys as he receives a call-up to represent the French national team for the first time at the senior level in a pair of FIBA World Cup qualifying games. France will play a challenging road game in Lithuania on Nov. 11, one of the top teams in Europe, followed by a home game on Nov. 14 against Bosnia and Herzegovina. These matchups will offer scouts yet another opportunity to see Wembanyama play in a new and different setting, something that should only add to the significant experience he already is garnering prior to being the inevitable No. 1 pick in the 2023 NBA draft. -- Jonathan Givony
 Just looking at Wembanyama, it’s easy to see why he’s a generational prospect. He stands at 7-foot-4 with nearly an 8-foot wingspan. When you combine that elite size with the skill Wembanyama has, he has the upside to one day be the best player in the entire NBA.
The defensive upside for a guy of Wembanyama’s size is obvious. The impact he’s able to make on that end of the floor is tremendous. If he’s not able to block a shot, he’s at least impacting it and drastically reducing the chance of the shooter converting. During the FIBA U19 World Cup, he produced nearly six blocks per game against some of the best young players in the world.
Wembanyama moves well in the paint, which allows him to be effective as a help-side defender. He’s known for blocking the shot of players he’s not even defending. The 7-footer has elite lateral quickness and is able to move his feet very well. As such, Wembanyama is great on the perimeter and has even proven to be effective defending guards and wings. He’s especially impactful in drop coverage.
While the French center has struggled some in the past with stronger and more physical bigs, Wembanyama has found ways to overcome that disadvantage. Even when players try to bully him and put him under the rim, he’s learned how to block shots and time his jump perfectly. It may initially appear he’s been driven under the rim and unable to affect the shot, but then he still finds a way to get the block.
Unlike many guys of his size, Wembanyama doesn’t just sit back in the paint waiting for the ball to come into the him. He can defend at the point of attack all the way to the rim before blocking a shot.
Offensively, Wembanyama is also a unicorn. His 3-point shot still needs some work, but most scouts have no concern that he’ll improve on that front. Especially for a guy of his size the mechanics are fluid and smooth, he just need more time to become a consistent shooter. He also takes very advanced looks from the perimeter on the move which somewhat deflates his true 3-point shooting numbers. Whether it’s off the bounce, fading away or pulling up from multiple feet behind the line, the 7-footer has the ability to knock it down. He’s got a high release point that allows him to shoot over anyone without his shot being altered.
Again, there’s still improvements that need to be made with the perimeter shot. Over the past few years, Wembanyama has been very up-and-down on his 3-point shooting efficiency. Defenders have to play up on him because he does have the ability to knock it down, but he’s certainly not an ultra efficient shooter from deep yet.
Right now Wembanyama gets away with a lot, especially as it relates to shot selection. He often settles for questionable looks when he could get an easy bucket any time he wants it. When the level of competition increases for him at the NBA level, it will be interesting to see if he can make better decisions.
Furthermore, his free throw shooting is improved but still needs work.
Not only is Wembanyama a floor spacer at his size, but he can of course produce points in the paint. He has incredibly soft touch around the rim, but can also dunk on nearly anyone. The 7-footer has an advanced post package, boasting a plethora of moves to get a clean look at the rim. Not only is he bigger than everyone, but Wembanyama actually has quality post moves.
The 19-year-old phenom is deadly in the pick-and-roll. He spaces the floor vertically unlike any other prospect we’ve seen in recent years. He should be a nightmare for defenses as the roll man or even when popping at next level. Wembanyama’s lob radius is next level, generating quick points for the offense and making life easy for guards running the action.
Outside of the intangibles and skill, Wembanyama is also a very smart player that processes the game at a high level. While he’s not playing against the best competition at this point, the speed at which he’s able to make reads and decisions is impressive.
All things considered, there’s still things Wembanyama could improve on. For starters, he’s got a habit of getting in foul trouble. If he’s able to become more disciplined on defense, that will only ensure he’s able to play as many minutes as possible at the NBA level.
Additionally, he isn’t an elite rebounder for how big he is. Sure, he’s had several games in which he absolutely dominates the glass but doesn't do it consistently enough. There's really no reason he shouldn't have double-digit boards every single night.
The obvious concern is with his frame. He’s actually not as skinny as some of the other centers we’ve evaluated in recent years, but there are some questions around injuries. Dating back to 2020, there’s been at least five injuries he’s suffered that have kept Wembanyama out for an extended period. In fact, his season was cut short last year due to injuries. This season with Boulogne-LevalloisMetropolitans 92, he was able to stay mostly healthy which was promising. 
Wembanyama is the best prospect in this class by a wide margin. Even if there is a risk with taking a guy of his size with the potential of injury longer term, it’s going to be impossible for any team to pass on him with the top pick. He brings so much to the table from a physical standpoint. Wembanyama could legitimately be the best player in the league in a few years.
After leaving ASVEL Villeurbanne to join Mets 92, Wembanyama's game continued to elevate. Some of the things he did this season were unlike anything we've ever seen from a guy his size or age. 
It would take a major red flag emerging between now and the draft for Wembanyama not to go No. 1 overall. Even if others in this class have a historic season, the intangibles the 7-footer possesses cannot be passed on. As long as he stays healthy, he’s the clear top prospect in the world right now."
Brandon Miller,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Paul George
Strengths:
An extremely talented 6’9 SF/PF with a lanky frame and very good length and athleticism … Has an intriguing scoring arsenal (leads all Fr with 18.8 ppg while shooting 45% from the field) … Can shoot over many wings due to his size and can also operate in the mid-range and occasionally in the post as well … A sniper from distance (44 3FG% on 7 attempts per game) with a quick release and range well past the NBA 3-point line whether spotting up, through screens or pulling up off the dribble … His size on the perimeter makes him effective at sticking contested shots … Has times when he can really get hot and take over games; as of now Miller has made 5 or more 3s in a game 5 times this season … Handles the ball adequately and is a threat creating offense for himself; needs little space to get his shots off … Makes good use of combo dribbles to free himself in the mid-range … Excellent transition player; runs the floor well and is an above the rim finisher in the open court … Versatility allows him to play as a SF or a ‘smallball’ PF … Good rebounding skills (8.2 rpg) and is much more physical than his slender frame would suggest … Competes on the defensive end and is able to guard effectively on the perimeter and along the frontcourt as well … Length and awareness allows him to be a pest shooting into passing lanes at times (1.1 spg), and he offers some resistance as a help side defender by swatting shots occasionally (nearly 1 bpg) … Unselfish player who’s willing to give the ball to open teammates … Makes hustle plays and works to get himself back in the action when out of position … Not afraid to take big shots down the stretch of games … Draws fouls at a decent rate and is solid when he gets there (82 FT% on 4.5 FTA per game) …
Weaknesses:
Though he has solid athleticism, he lacks great burst and explosiveness … Sometimes has a hard time separating off the dribble and has to take contested shots … Doesn’t get to the rim that much in half court offense … Nothing more than decent as a leaper, and Miller doesn’t convert amongst the trees at a great rate (46 FG% inside the arc) … Needs to add some muscle to his frame; not great at finishing through contact at the moment … At times falls in love with the jump shot; can stand to improve on picking his spots … Could look to add a little more arch to his shot which can be flat … Has moments when aggressive pressure throws him off his game, but he usually does a good job adjusting to the defense … Won’t realize his true defensive potential until he adds the muscle needed to defend bigger PFs … Willing to pass the ball, but isn’t much of a playmaker for others and is more so wired to score … Tough to see him posting up much at the NBA level given his lack of strength currently; can use his size to his advantage down low in college at times but that will be more difficult against longer NBA defenders … Will be 21 years old as a rookie; is older than your typical one-and-done prospect …
Overall:
Miller was a consensus 5 star prospect who came to Alabama after thinking about joining the G-League following his HS career, and has been a huge reason why the Crimson Tide have been a top 5 team for the vast majority of this season … The prolific shooting he displayed in his amateur career has carried over to the college level and he has completely taken over games and lit up the scoreboard throughout his Fr season, and that makes him a promising prospect … On top of that, he rebounds well, plays with enthusiasm, and is a switchable defender that is tailor-made for NBA action … Still, he lacks truly great quickness and needs to add strength to stand the grind of an 82 game season … Still, his shooting and scoring potential, as well as his rebounding are nice and give him the groundwork of a lottery selection in the 2023 NBA Draft who should have an immediate impact for whoever selects him …
Jorrye Nixon 2/7/23
Strengths:
6’9 versatile forward … Good size and versatility. Difficult matchup for anyone at this level. Can score inside and out. Very good iso scorer and a threat from anywhere on the floor … Fluid and high-level athlete, especially when he gets a full approach off one foot. Very good in the open floor … Good rotation and mechanics on shot with range that extends to the 3PT line. Good fadeaway in the post and from midrange. Solid pull-up jumper and has the ability to hit tough shots. Reliable free throw shooter … Good tools and versatility as a defender. Shows ability to switch onto each position at this level. Has a knack for chase down and help-side blocks, covering more ground than he would appear. Averaged 1.9 blocks per game over the Nike EYBL in 2021 … Makes impressive passes, especially at his size. Capable of bullet passes off the dribble … Good rebounder. Averaged 8.9 rebounds per game over the Nike EYBL in 2021 …
Weaknesses:
Lacks scoring efficiency and 3PT consistency. Averaged 12.9 points per game on 43.1% FG% and shot 27.6% 3PT% on 1.9 3PT attempts per game over the Nike EYBL in 2021 … Quick with the trigger and settles for outside shots/pull-ups. Lacks slashing ability and wiggle as he usually struggles to get all the way to the rim … Good versatility defensively, but roams a bit at this stage, not really locking in … Not a bad ball-handler, handles well enough to keep the defense honest, but can improve handling in traffic and as mentioned earlier, doesn’t really get by anyone with his dribble. Averaged 2.3 assists to 2.5 turnovers per game over the Nike EYBL in 2021 … Drifts to the perimeter often and can get more movement off the ball. Doesn’t utilize his size advantage around the basket as often as he should … Wears his emotions at times. Can pick up intensity on both ends … Older for his class, will turn 20 around the start of his freshman season …
Outlook:
Incoming Alabama freshman … 2022 McDonald’s All-American … Played in the 2022 Jordan Brand Classic … Played in the 2022 Iverson Classic … 2021 and 2022 Gatorade Player of the Year …
Evan Tomes 7/5/22   MVP honors in the SEC tournament put Miller firmly in the mix for the No. 2 pick, as he led Alabama's high-powered offense and showed significant potential as a big playmaking wing with outstanding passing and shot-making.

A groin injury slowed Miller in the NCAA tournament and might have contributed to Alabama having one of its worst offensive games of the season in its Sweet 16 loss to San Diego State. Miller shot 3-for-19 from the field with six turnovers, while the Crimson Tide were limited to 3-for-27 from beyond the arc.

Miller's shooting splits against elite competition are alarming. He converted 39% of his 2-pointers and 32% of his 3s in 19 games against top-50 opponents but shot 63% on 2s and 45% on 3s in his 18 other games, per Bart Torvik.

Miller's inability to create separation against San Diego State's defense raised many of the red flags previously identified, with his lack of explosiveness and reliance on difficult attempts around the basket and beyond the arc. Still, it was encouraging to see Miller's aggressiveness, extraordinary pass timing and creativity off a live dribble with his off-hand, having the type of vision and playmaking ability every NBA team would love to have in a 6-9 guard.

Even when he wasn't scoring, Miller continued to bring impressive intensity on the defensive end, something that had been in question before this season.

Miller, a 40% 3-point shooter before the NCAA tournament, hit a slump at a bad time for Alabama, hitting just 3-for-19 in three games from beyond the arc. That shouldn't play a large role in how he's viewed as an NBA prospect, though, considering his shot-making prowess and 86% free throw percentage. Instead, teams will wonder just how heavy a role Miller can shoulder as a half-court creator in the NBA, something his development as a passer, lack of explosiveness and still-developing frame will help determine.

Ultimately, the team that gets the No. 2 pick in the draft and what that team has on its roster -- plus what it is able to uncover regarding Miller's involvement in the shooting of Jamea Harris, for which he has not been charged -- will be deciding factors in whether it's Miller or G League Ignite guard Scoot Henderson who gets the call first on draft night. Miller's season as a whole was a resounding success, even if he's disappointed in how it ended. -- Jonathan Givony  Miller is already 20 years old, meaning he will be older than other one-and-done peers in this class. He will be 21 early in the 2023-24 season as a rookie, but has so much upside that it won't matter on draft night.
The Alabama freshman has great size as a combo forward that can play on the perimeter as a true wing or as a modern power forward. He’s the ideal build for the positionless NBA where versatility is key.
Despite being a tall forward, Miller has a very smooth jumper. He can hit jump shots moving off the bounce or in rhythm. He’s pretty good at generating his own shot, which will translate nicely given how isolation heavy the NBA is.
Miller thrives in the midrange, where he love to face up smaller defenders before making a move. His turnaround game is also effective, as he uses his height to elevate over defenders.
The Alabama freshman has the range to shoot from beyond the arc but and emerged as one of the best 3-point shooters in the country last season. Whether it was in rhythm or off the bounce, he showed the ability to make perimeter shots of all types. The mechanics and release are great and he has the size to shoot over nearly anyone. 
Miller has really good vision for a forward. He can whip a one handed pass with accuracy across the court and has high-low potential playing alongside a big in the frontcourt. He’s also comfortable bringing the ball up the floor and working as a facilitator. Relative to his size and position, Miller has good handles.
He’s a strong finisher at the rim, where he often dunks with power. Miller is a pretty good athlete although he’s somewhat slim.
On the defensive end, he moves his feet really well. Miller is laterally quick for his size and uses his length to block shots. He should theoretically be able to guard multiple positions moving forward.
He’s was a former five-star recruit and one of the best wings in his high school class, but has emerged as the top wing prospect in the upcoming rookie class. The Alabama star won back-to-back Tennessee Gatorade Player of the Year awards and was best player in the state for years before making the college leap. His father, Darrell Miller, played tight end at Alabama, so he was a second-generation athlete in Tuscaloosa."
Scoot Henderson,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Derrick Rose/Ja Morant
Strengths:
Henderson is a 6’2 190 guard with outstanding length (wingspan reported to be around 6’9) and a strong build already as a 19 year old … He also possesses standout athleticism, as he has top-notch speed, agility, body control and explosive leaping ability off one or both feet … Aggressive; has very little problems getting where he wants to on the court, even when turning the corner against ball hedges or traps, and does a great job of pressuring the defense with his burst and speed but also decelerating and/or stopping on a dime to keep defenders off balance … Absorbs contact and is rarely knocked off his pivot when slashing to the rim … Can also finish at the rim over and through defenders in emphatic fashion due to his strength and leaping skills … Likes to operate at the point of attack to create offense for himself and his teammates, and is most comfortable with the ball in his hands … Very tricky player to stay in front of due to the slithery footwork, great 1st step and outstanding ball-handling skills that he displays … More patient than your typical explosive, speed demon type PG his age; willing to let plays and passing lanes develop to make well-timed feeds to open teammates if the defense is tilted too much his way … Good mid-range scorer going in either direction but especially to his right; with all kinds of smooth dribbling ability to subtly drift and navigate laterally to open space for shots if he can’t get downhill … Good shot mechanics give some optimism that he can extend his shooting range in the future; shows a decent follow-through and always looks balanced when rising into his jumper … Strings together hesitation and inside-out moves masterfully, weaving inside and around the defense to get space for his pull-up jumpers and floaters in the lane … Also can convert with either hand around the rim, where he shows strong creativity in avoiding shot-blockers and getting shots on the rim/backboard with good touch … Not a bad option to have the ball in his hands late in the shot clock … Will be a major handful in both transition and pick-and-roll offense with his ability to collapse the paint and score near the hoop & 15-18 ft area (16.5 ppg in 22-23 season), but defenders must also be mindful of his strong playmaking skills on the move that allows him to hit open teammates for easy shots often as well (6.8 apg) … Prefers to score but just about as effective as a passer and generally shows a really solid basketball IQ for a young prospect with his on-court decision making (2:1 A:TO) … Mix of length, athleticism and energy on the defensive end are encouraging; tools are there for him to at least be a threat to force turnovers or recover from mistakes effectively as he gains more experience (1.1 spg, 11 blocks in 19 games last season) … Willing rebounder from the lead guard spot who can initiate on the go after missed shots, applying pressure before the defense can get set (5.3 rpg) … Has flair to his game and will be a highlight waiting to happen, especially with the types of dunks/finishes he can pull off … Never seemed to run from the idea of being a main face on his teams after elevating to the G-League early out of HS, which is encouraging as someone who will potentially be seen as a franchise-changing player in the pros  …
Weaknesses:
3-point shot needs improvement (27 3FG%); added range and consistency would make him an even more dangerous matchup problem offensively … Currently more comfortable taking lower percentage shots off the dribble than open with his feet set (42 FG%) … Will inevitably be dared to shoot deep shots and has to prove that he has to be guarded in the screen game to keep defenses honest, which will have an impact on spacing given how often he operates in those types of actions … Dictates the pace well, but sometimes spends too much time pounding the rock which can stagnate the offensive flow … Natural feel for being a playmaker for others can stand to improve; sometimes takes ill-advised shots before looking to set up the offense … Given the pressure he puts on the defense, his lack of trips to the charity stripe in the G-League was disappointing (2.9 FTA/G, on 76.4%) … A work in progress defensively, not yet being consistent on a possession-by-possession basis … Got washed out of ball screen action too easily at times last season, needs to improve his ability to navigate switches … Doesn’t deny dribble penetration as effectively as someone with his tools should currently, and also doesn’t use his length to contest or offer resistance when guarding taller players enough either … Coaches will also want to work on his fundamentals and understanding of principles on that end, and he was often late to rotate or out of position when off the ball, which led to too many open shots this past season …
Overall:
Scoot Henderson has been a heralded name in the amateur circuit as early as winter 2019 when he was lighting up the scoreboard at Kell HS in the Atlanta area as a Soph … He went on to have an even more prolific run of scoring as a Jr., averaging 32 ppg, before bypassing his Sr. season to play professionally with the NBA G-League Ignite in 2021, where he became the leagues youngest player ever at 17 years old … During his rookie year in the G-League program, he had good production (14 ppg, 4 rpg & 4 apg) on a team that featured eventual 2022 Draft picks like Dyson Daniels, Jaden Hardy and Marjon Beauchamp … He upped his stats in nearly every category in Year 2 with the team and showed off his elite athleticism and ability to take over games as a scorer and facilitator … He will definitely need to work on his 3-point shot and correct some of his flaws on defense, but the groundwork is there for him to take a step forward in both areas…His shot isn’t broken from a form or touch standpoint, and he already is effective in the mid-range … Defensively he has all the physical tools (except average height) to improve defensively as long as he gains experience and works on his attention to detail and fundamentals…If he can get his 3-ball to around league average territory, watch out … Scoot Henderson with the threat of making 3s has the potential to be arguably the best PG prospect in quite some time that could revolutionize the position over the next decade, similarly to Derrick Rose & Russell Westbrook 15 years ago … Even if he never quite becomes consistent with it he will be a high floor prospect who can provide flamboyant highlights and instant outstanding offensive production with his ability to pressure the defense … Look for Henderson to be a top 3 pick, with him having a very good chance of hearing his name at #2 to Charlotte after the Victor Wembanyama to San Antonio pick …
Jorrye Nixon 5/22/23  Scoot Henderson, the projected No. 2 pick in the draft, had a productive stat line in his regular-season debut with 25 points and seven assists. But he wasn't able to help the Ignite avoid blowing a 29-point first-half lead and losing their home opener. His shot selection left something to be desired, as he was baited into difficult midrange jumpers all game long by Oklahoma City's deep drop defense, hitting just four of his 12 pull-up 2s and not attempting a single 3-pointer. He was able to draw 10 fouls, though, some of which appeared fortuitous, but he wasn't able to control the tempo of the game as effectively as he did in the Ignite's opening game against Wembanyama's Metropolitans 92, during which he looked far more aggressive getting out in the open floor and attacking the basket in the half court.  Defensively, Henderson showed some flashes, fighting over screens and generating turnovers both on and off the ball with his quick feet, strong frame and long arms. But he often was sleepy off the ball, not always maintaining his intensity, especially when things weren't going his way offensively.  Henderson's second game of the season on Sunday was similarly a mixed bag, as he needed 28 shots to score 25 points and made some critical mistakes down the stretch that played a role in his team coughing up a late lead and losing a 120-119 heartbreaker to Salt Lake City.  Henderson's best moments looked all-star caliber. When he is at his best, he is using his terrific ballhandling ability and explosive change of gears to get into the paint and either finish with creativity or dish off to teammates after moving the defense. He threw in several good-looking pull-up jumpers, had a few incredible highlights in the open court and played a strong game defensively, using his frame, quick feet and hands to generate plenty of turnovers and looking much improved in that area from last season.  Henderson's decision-making in the half court is still very much a work in progress -- not a shock considering he is an 18-year-old leading a group of mostly draft-eligible players against veteran professionals. With Salt Lake City shrinking the floor late and daring him to shoot jumpers, Henderson had some wild moments forcing the issue and coming up empty when his team needed a bucket, surprisingly causing the Ignite to put the ball in the hands of teammate Sidy Cissoko during their crucial final possession.  Overall, Henderson showed his substantial talent against players significantly older than him without even playing all that well by his standards. It was yet another indication of how much long-term upside he possesses. The gap between him and Wembanyama looks considerable at the moment, and scouts will want to see Henderson help a very young Ignite team win some games in the G League if he is to hold off the likes of Amen Thompson, Nick Smith and others from the No. 2 spot in the draft. -- Jonathan Givony
 By the time he’s drafted, Henderson will have two full seasons of professional experience in the G League. If it weren’t for a generational prospect like Victor Wembanyama being in this class, Henderson would be in the running for the No. 1 pick at this point.
While Henderson does lack height at 6-foot-2, his athleticism, strength and 6-foot-9 wingspan make up for it. He’s ready today to be the point guard of an NBA team.
An elite leaper, Henderson is incredibly explosive. He’s one of the better athletes in this class, which is saying something given who that puts him up against.
The unique compilation of speed and explosiveness makes Henderson a menace in transition. Even in half-court sets, he is slippery in traffic and experienced in dissecting defenses off the dribble. Furthermore, he’s smart with the ball and takes good care of it.
Whether Henderson dunks the ball with emphasis at the end of a drive or lays it in with finesse, his touch near the rim is elite. He’s able to convert on highly difficult attempts with either hand. He’s got a ridiculous first step and a robust layup package that’s only getting better. Not only does he have to speed to blow by defenders, but Henderson also has a deadly hesitation dribble that keeps defenses guessing where he’s going next.
The basketball IQ of Henderson is impressive given his age, rarely making major mistakes despite playing at the professional level as a teenager.
The one knock on Henderson is his 3-point shot. For two-straight seasons in the G League, he made less than 30% of his attempts from beyond the arc. With that in mind, he has a very effective midrange jumper that gives us optimism the deeper shot will come around. It’s worth noting he went from a high school 3-point line to the NBA distance, which is quite an adjustment.
Again, the Henderson’s midrange game is really good. He’s great at squaring up his body to the rim regardless of how advanced the actual shot he’s taking is. As such, he’s an elite scorer at two levels, but needs to improve drastically from deep round out his offensive game.
While he’s projected to be one of the top three picks either way, the 3-point shot is what most teams will keep a close eye on the pre-draft process. The mechanics are fluid and quick, which is a promising sign for the young guard.
Not only is Henderson a great scorer, but he’s also a facilitator as a true point guard. He produced nearly four assists per game in his first Ignite season as a 17-year-old, then almost seven in year two. He’s also a fantastic positional rebounder, notching roughly five per contest in two seasons at the G League level. Henderson has a nose for the ball, which is why he’s an underrated offensive rebounder.
Defensively, Henderson is pesky but undisciplined at times. He’s got work to do on that end, especially as it relates to limiting fouls. What is promising is that he’s got good natural timing as a shot blocker and has flashed upside on that end.
Henderson was one of the primary scorers for the Ignite the last two seasons, even when he had to compete with several other great guards for shots in Jaden Hardy, Dyson Daniels and others. He showed that he is an alpha and ready to be the face of an NBA team as soon as next season. 
Behind Victor Wembanyama, who will be the top pick in the 2023 NBA Draft, Henderson will compete with Brandon Miller for the second prospect taken off the board."
Amen Thompson,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Latrell Sprewell
Strengths:
Thompson is a 6’7 210 perimeter player who is physically gifted enough to play 1-3 at the pro level, with especially good size for the PG spot that he’s mostly viewed at as a prospect … Freakishly athletic; has outstanding speed, quickness and explodes off the floor as a leaper … Threatens the paint in a blur with his 1st step; even has success slashing against perfectly set defenders in the halfcourt because of his speed … Has an unorthodox rhythm with the ball that when mixed with his speed gives him the potential to keep defenders off balance and on his hip in the pick and roll game; allowing him to find open teammates or create slashing lanes to attack for himself … Likes handling and unselfishly finding streaking teammates in transition, being most comfortable passing on the move (6 apg in 22-23) … Developing ability to read the defense on the move and find the open man when bigs hedge or extra defenders collapse onto him … Has the good floor vision that generally comes with being a taller lead guard; makes good hit ahead passes and can whip cross-court passes to cutters and spot-up shooters when needed … Runs the floor like a deer and is an outstanding overall transition player … Easy above the rim finisher (32 dunks this season) who can convert even when he takes off much further out than the restricted area in the key … Glides in the air and can adjust to shot-blockers with reasonable success … Even shows good timing as a cutter off the ball to get easy finishes … Good rebounder (6 rpg) for a perimeter player; can create favorable transition opportunities after grabbing missed shots due to his speed with the ball and ability to attack before the defense can set … Matches up well PG-SF defensively on the perimeter given his physical tools, and he was a quick-handed ball thief with Overtime Elite (2.4 spg) … His coaches will want to develop his defensive acumen in hopes of him making an impact player on that end … Has drawn some positive reviews in his work ethic over the last year or 2, which is encouraging …
Weaknesses:
Jump shot is a big concern currently (25 3FG%); really needs to overhaul his mechanics … Has rigid form and an awkward follow-through that doesn’t even hold up well when left open, let alone when contested by a defender … Little in the way of a mid-range game or floater to alleviate 3-point shooting concerns; will be sagged off of and dared to shoot routinely in isolation or screening action & will need to be surrounded by shooting threats to best deal with spacing concerns … Poses minimal threat in half-court offense if he’s not handling the ball due to his lack of shooting … Not a natural scorer; lacks a go-to move and won’t do much damage outside of 5 ft from the basket … Also not a natural playmaker; doesn’t always make sound reads when the game slows down and will try to do too much as a passer looking for the home run play (3.3 topg, 1.74:1 A:TO) … Often doesn’t know what to do when he can’t break down the defense with his speed; would like to see him pick his spots a bit better … Below average FT shooter for a perimeter player (65 FT% on just over 4 FTA/G)…Defensive fundamentals are a work in progress; doesn’t deny dribble penetration the way his tools would suggest … Currently gets washed out of plays when screened often and plays ‘too tall’ as an oversized PG, allowing players with a lower center of gravity to beat him to spots … Overzealous trying to get steals or leak out for transition opportunities, leaving his teammates out to dry with difficult rotations to manage … A bit older for an Overtime Elite player at 20, which is worth note …
Overall:
Amen Thompson is a prospect who, alongside his twin brother and fellow projected 2023 lottery pick Ausur, has been a noteworthy prospect since around 2019 after moving from California to south Florida in 8th grade a few years prior … After a decorated HS career and garnering top 50 level recruit status, both Amen and his brother decided to skip their last season of HS and sign a 2-year contract to the Overtime Elite program based out of Atlanta in 2021 to prepare the NBA Draft … Thompson played against prep school, post-grad prospects and other Overtime Elite teams with age ranges from 16-20 and enjoyed productive seasons, including averaging about 15 ppg, 6 boards and 6 assists a night this past season … He showed his elite athleticism, speed and transition ability while also intriguing with his potential as a passer and defender, but also showed some clear flaws in his shooting and as a decision-maker that will need to be cleaned up if he’s to reach his potential as a prospect … It is worth note that he had 2 years to re-work his shooting form and grow his confidence but didn’t capitalize on it … His defense also needs some tuning despite some encouraging signs that may eventually come with more experience … He has an interesting profile, with clear strengths and flaws, and it will be interesting to see just how they are worked out in the future, but as it stands Thompson is very likely to be lottery selection in the 2023 NBA Draft and would fit best with a fast-paced squad who can let him play to his strengths, but he is a bit raw and will need time to develop his ability to operate outside of the paint  …

Jorrye Nixon 5/23/23  The biggest draw for scouts was the presence of the projected top-10 picks with elite physical talent, lockdown defensive prowess and an intriguing combination of open-court scoring, dynamic playmaking, feel for the game and creativity.  Amen Thompson had a strong showing in drills and live action, showing the progress he's made as an outside shooter along with his highlight-reel finishing, live-ball passing and competitiveness defensively that gives him a high floor as a prospect as well as significant long-term upside. Thompson has steadily risen up draft boards this summer and fall thanks to outstanding showings against high-level competition at the TBT tournament, an overseas tour against ACB squads Manresa and Girona, Adriatic league teams Mega Basket and Studentski Centar, and an exhibition game in Phoenix against Australian NBL squad Adelaide 36ers -- who then went onto defeat the Phoenix Suns.  While G League Ignite's Scoot Henderson could very well solidify himself as the main consolation prize in the Victor Wembanyama sweepstakes, Thompson's super size (6-foot-7), explosiveness and incredible highlights he produces getting low to the ground off powerful hesitation moves and finishing with extraordinary body control and agility in the lane give him a chance to surpass Henderson ultimately if he continues along his current trajectory.  Having passed early tests, the question now will be how the Thompsons continue their development, as OTE returns to mostly playing high school-level competition in their six-team league schedule from November to mid-March. After being on separate teams last season, Amen will reunite with his twin brother Ausar on the City Reapers, offering scouts a chance to evaluate the two alongside each other. The move offers pros and cons for both players and scouts.  On one hand, it will force the twins to show they can impact the game without having the ball in their hands all the time, a situation that will more closely replicate their experience early in their NBA careers, where they will share the floor with other talented players.  On the other, it's not easy for NBA scouts to differentiate between the identical twins in live action, and the fact that Amen is the more dominant ballhandler of the two may lead to his brother Ausar being overshadowed at times. While they're different players in many regards -- Ausar is usually considered more of a wing than Amen, who is clearly a guard -- they also share quite a few similarities in terms of their physical attributes, shooting, powerful downhill driving and ability to guard multiple positions.  Although NBA scouts don't unanimously agree on who the better prospect of the twins is, there is no question Amen has been much more productive so far than Ausar, who hasn't made the same jump in terms of scoring efficiency or aggressiveness from last season. Amen is currently ranked No. 3 on ESPN's mock draft, while Ausar is No. 8, a situation that was flipped for much of last year.  Kevin Ollie, Head of Coaching and Basketball Development at OTE, discussed what makes the twins unique. ""God has sprinkled magical dust on these two,"" he said. ""Being 6-7 and being able to jump like that? It's hard to peg them in a position. Defensively they are both incredible.""  He also spoke about what the Thompson twins need to improve on. ""We want to get them better off the ball. On the ball they are amazing,"" he said. ""They can still grow from a leadership standpoint, being vocal. From a leadership standpoint that's important. Off the court, they are quiet but they are starting to find their voice. Ausar talks more than Amen. We need to make the game easier for teammates.  ""They want to be perfect a lot. I would rather have a guy want to be perfect than need to challenge them. We don't need to turn them up. They compete at everything they do. They don't want to lose. We're working on their shots. Working on different moves. Mastering the fundamentals. It's all about footwork and balance. Their shots are getting better. They put the time in. Each and every day they do it the right way."" -- Jonathan Givony
 The twin brother of Ausar Thompson, Amen Thomson is an offensive-minded jumbo guard that makes big things happen with the ball in his hands. He’s an absolutely elite athlete, not just among this draft class, but relative to all basketball players on the planet.
Thompson has great size for his position and skillset to go along with being an elite leaper, especially off of two feet. As of today, he’s best suited scoring the ball while attacking the rim. He’s got an extremely quick first step and is explosive when taking off for a shot.
The potential top-five pick is overall great off the bounce, boasting variety of dribble moves. He gets to the rim with ease, leveraging crossovers, spins, hesitations and pure blow by quickness. With that in mind, there’s times in which he is somewhat loose with the ball, which will need to be tightened up moving forward.
Thompson isn’t just good in the halfcourt as is relates to generating shots at the rim, but he’s fantastic in transition. This is often where he puts on a show and produces highlight dunks. Rarely do we see players with the combination of size and quickness that the Overtime Elite prospect has.
When the 6-foot-7 guard gets near the rim, he can finish with power or float in the air and show off his unique layup package. He’s also great at finishing with both hands.
Outside of the absurd athleticism, Thompson also has great natural feel for the game overall offensively. He has legitimate guard skills despite having the size and length of a wing or forward. He’s really emerged as a great facilitator over the past few years, showcasing his ability to pass the ball.
Not only can the combo guard score and pass at a high level, but he’s also generates a high number of rebounds for his position. As such, he’s a triple-double threat any time he touches the floor, which should continue at the NBA level.
The one thing holding Thompson back from being a guaranteed top-three pick is his perimeter shot. While he is has improved some, this will absolutely be what teams are focused on in the pre-draft process. 
Thompson certainly isn’t the defender that his twin brother Ausar is, but the upside is there. He’s got long arms and lateral quickness that many players his age don’t have. He’s versatile and has the tools to guard at least three positions. Furthermore, Thompson struggles from the free throw line. This doesn’t mean he can’t become a better 3-point shooter, but often times free throw performance can be indicative of future shooting improvement.
Thompson certainly isn’t the defender that his twin brother Ausar is, but the upside is there. He’s got long arms and lateral quickness that many players his age don’t have. He’s versatile and has the tools to guard at least three positions.
Playing in the Overtime Elite system is interesting, as it’s a unique path that’s different to analyze and scout relative to more traditional methods of making it to the NBA. A former five-star recruit, Thompson could potentially be affected by this if teams don’t feel they’ve been able to see him play against top competition where the stakes are extremely high.
Furthermore, Thomson is older than some of the other top prospects in this class. This might not matter to most, but it is something that NBA franchises think about.
The Thompson twins are originally from Oakland, but moved to Florida before high school. They have an older brother, Troy Thompson, that played college and G League basketball, so playing at this level is in their DNA."
Ausar Thompson,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Trevor Ariza
Strengths:
Thompson is a 6’7 215 wing with the physical tools to fit seamlessly on the perimeter … Also possesses explosive athleticism, easy lateral movements and dynamic speed, possessing an extra gear that can stack players on their heels in a hurry … Great 1st step … An asset as an open court player with his ability to run the floor and jump out the gym; good finisher who gets plenty of alley-oops and projects be able to get himself some easy points just by filling lanes in transition … High level defensive potential … Can adjust in mid-air to convert pretty well against contests at the rim … Doesn’t always need plays drawn up for him to be effective; will make backdoor cuts and aggressively attack the offensive glass & generally displays a high motor … Unselfish player who shows good timing & feel as a passer from the wing (5.1 APG in ‘22-23), especially on the move … Makes good outlet passes … Pretty good at reading help defense and finding the open man … Solid rebounder (6.1 RPG) who can initiate offense and reward teammates who leak out with hit-aheads after missed shots … Has the tools and the right approach to be an impact player on the defensive end; moves his feet to deny penetration, gets steals (2.1 SPG) and likes to turn defense into offense … His willingness to help when his teammates get beat is commendable; rangy enough to freelance and disrupt action … Plays with good energy and is competitive; has been lauded for his intangibles and work ethic by many associated with the Overtime Elite program …
Weaknesses:
Can be too reliant on his athleticism; doesn’t really know how to improvise when his quickness and burst don’t suffice, at the moment … Not a natural scorer and doesn’t have much nuance to creating his own offense … Jump shot is a work in progress both spotting up and off the bounce … Only shot 65% from the FT line…Shot selection isn’t always the best in halfcourt offense; takes too many off-balance shots off the dribble that seem like bailouts … Would be well-served to work on his jumper with his feet set; would compliment his live athleticism well … Can get out of control and make wild passes and shot attempts when the defense corrals him … Doesn’t always play to his strengths offensively and needs to have a better understanding of his limitations to maximize his value on the court … Can be careless with the ball at times, particularly as a passer, and has a much higher turnover rate than your typical wing (3.3 TOPG) … Fundamentals on defense need some work; doesn’t get in a stance consistently leading to him giving up more dribble drive lanes than he should … Gambles and can leave his team defense out to dry at times, particularly when trying to come up with steals … Advanced age for OTE at 20 years old, which is worth note …
Overall:
Ausar Thompson who, alongside his twin brother and projected 2023 Draft lottery selection Amen, has been a prospect since around 2019 when he moved from California to South Florida prior to HS … He had a decorated HS career and solidified his standing as a top 50 prospect but decided to sign a 2-year contract to play in the Overtime Elite program based out of Atlanta in 2021 to prepare for the NBA Draft … He was productive, putting up over 16 PPG 6 RPG 5 APG and 2.1 SPG this past season while showing his outstanding athleticism that’s build for transition play, unselfishness and potential on the defensive end … He also showed that he’s a bit raw and has some work to do on his fundamentals on both ends of the court, could use some fine-tuning on his shooting both when stationary and off the dribble, and a need to work on his half-court skill level … The strides he made as a shooter are encouraging, and if he can continue to keep putting in work as a shooter, especially with his feet set, he has a good chance to carve out a role for himself given his unique athletic traits, defensive potential and ability to pass the ball in transition and when on the move … His work ethic has been praised, particularly by Kevin Ollie, a former NBA vet and college head coach who is a main person overseeing the Overtime Elite program, which is encouraging and something to build on, and we may not be looking at anything close to the finished product with Ausar Thompson … Thompson is currently being mocked as high as the top 5 and he definitely projects to be a lottery pick in the 2023 Draft, where he could be a productive player for a team that doesn’t rush him and allows him to play at his strengths while working hard to round out his game to help him maximize his ability ..

 The twin brother of Amen Thompson, Ausar Thomson is a defensive-minded player that’s better suited as more of a wing. He’s extremely bouncy and has great feel on that end, which is why he’s able to block so many shots. He is able to get off the ground quickly to high point the ball.
The versatility of Thompson as a defender is special, with him having the ability to guard four positions at a very high level.
The 6-foot-7 wing is extremely long and boasts great footwork. He’s got the lateral quickness to stay in front of guards, but the size and athleticism to take on more modern power forwards. Thompson uses his length and active hands to stay in passing lanes and generate a ton of deflections. When he does steal the ball, he’s great in transition and can finish with authority.
Simply put, Thompson gets it defensively. He plays well within a system and knows his assignment. He often bails teammates out as a helpside defender and blocks quite a few shots of players he’s not even guarding.
There are times when the Overtime Elite prospect does rely on athleticism too much on defense and is undisciplined, but that shouldn’t be too worrisome given he’ll be in a more concrete role and scheme at the next level.
While Thompson doesn’t have the offensive upside of his twin brother, Amen, he’s still not a bad prospect on that end. In fact, he has the better jumper of the two as of today. To be clear, Ausar Thompson is not an elite shooter, but he is the better of the twins right now.
The one thing holding Thompson back from being a guaranteed top-five pick is his jump shot. While he is a much improved shooter, this will absolutely be his swing skill and will determine where he’s selected in the lottery this summer.
The jumper needed quite a bit of work entering last season, almost to the point where it’s somewhat worrisome. However, he worked with some of the top trainers and coaches in the country to improve his mechanics and has somewhat alleviated those concerns. His numbers from deep this this season were respectable and he can further prove he's improved in pre-draft workouts. He’s already great at getting to the rim, but forcing defenses to stay honest on the perimeter will enhance that ability. 
Again, this Thompson twin is more of an off-ball wing, but he does have a good handle for his size and is a decent passer. He can be turnover prone is generally a solid facilitator relative to other wing prospects.
Given he’s 6-foot-7 with good bounce, Thompson is also a quality rebounder.
Overall, Thompson has natural feel and tools make him an elite defensive prospect. He’s on track to becoming a better scorer, but still doesn’t project to be the top offensive option on an NBA team right now.
Playing with Overtime Elite makes scouting Thompson a bit different for NBA teams. The former five-star recruit might be missing out on playing against top level competition with high stakes. Additionally, he’s a bit older than some of the other top prospects in this upcoming class, which may or may not matter at all.
The Thompson twins went to high school in Florida, but grew up in Oakland. They’re following in the footsteps of their older brother, Troy Thompson, who played at both the college and G League levels."
Anthony Black,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Josh Giddey/Steve Smith
Strengths:
A physically gifted PG/SG who stands a legitimate 6’7 200 lbs with the frame to add muscle easily … A smooth athlete who has solid body control & leaping ability, and will likely improve his explosiveness with time in an NBA teams training program..Is most comfortable acting as a playmaker for his teammates offensively (4 apg as a Fr.); plays unselfishly, is more steady than flashy, and has promising floor vision as you’d expect from a taller lead guard … Likes to play in the pick and roll game, and was especially good at finding shooters and cutters when some of Arkansas’ main contributors were healthy earlier in the season … Lulls defenders and changes pace pretty well off the bounce to open slashing lanes for himself … Generally accurate making passes on the move and finding streaking players in transition … Isn’t bad when he calls his own number in transition either; gains a head of steam and can convert above the rim in the open floor … Uses his size well when looking to finish plays at the rim against smaller guards, should only get better with more strength (50.3 FG% inside the arc) … Has been an excellent defensive player this season and will be able to defend PG-SF as a pro eventually as he gains experience … Possesses very quick hands and anticipation to swipe and create turnovers (1.9 spg), but also smothers slashers with his length and active feet, forcing difficult shots … Rebounds nicely from the perimeter (5.3 rpg) and looks to get transition opportunities quickly with hit-ahead passes after getting boards and steals … Above average on the offensive glass for a guard prospect as well (1.3 orpg); seemingly has gotten a 2nd chance basket every game as a Fr … Seems to be more comfortable in command of the offense, but has shown that he can play off-ball and flashes the awareness necessary to cut to open spots for shots near the rim … Has the skill set of someone who will potentially be a triple double threat, competes with good energy and contributes in multiple ways when on the court
Weaknesses:
Some question his toughness and leadership as he didn’t put up a big fight when Nick Smith got healthy and seemed to defer the team over to Smith … More smooth than explosive; not especially quick and doesn’t always separate from defenders off the dribble…Not a natural scorer and lacks some polish to his floor game operating in the half court…Currently struggles a bit as a shooter (30 3FG% on 2.8 attempts a game); gets little elevation on his shot and his follow through doesn’t hold up well when asked to make jumpers off the dribble, leading to some bad misses…Minimal mid-range game…Would do him wonders to work on consistently making open jumpers, as defenders will sag off him and dive his screens until he proves to be more of a threat…As of now, Black is tied for the most totals turnovers in the SEC (3.2 topg)…For as unselfish as he is, Black too often drives the lane with pre-determined reads in mind and will force passes even if the defense has him walled off…Needs to work on not telegraphing where he wants to go with the ball; also is prone to leaving his feet when passing the ball…Some of his inefficient passing can be attributed to the lack of spacing that Arkansas has offensively due to reluctant, albeit poor team 3-point shooting that allows defenses to overload inside the arc, but his decision making as a passer can certainly improve…Plays with a higher center of gravity and can at times be susceptible to having the ball swiped away from him when slashing to the rim…Can contribute in a number of ways offensively, but doesn’t quite stand out at anything currently … Maturity? There are some attitude concerns which likely will be flushed out by lottery teams in the interview process …
Overall:
Anthony Black was a consensus 5-star recruit as well as a McDonalds All-American out of Texas in HS, who signed to a very highly regarded 2022 Arkansas recruiting class that featured a few other blue chip recruits and was seen as a preseason Final 4 dark horse … Due to injuries to another projected lottery pick in Fr. Nick Smith and athletic big man and pick and roll partner Trevon Brazille, Black has been forced to shoulder more of a load than expected and Arkansas started slow in SEC play, but he has stepped up a number of times this season and intrigued NBA scouts with his upside, size, passing and defense … He possesses positional versatility on both ends of the floor despite clearly being more of an on-ball player, and really has terrific potential defensively with his ability to force turnovers and use his physical tools to his advantage … There are questions about his scoring/shooting potential, and his overall efficiency offensively due to middling shooting percentages and A:TO, as he seems to have a good deal of polish and fundamentals to add to his game … Still, he has the type of skill set to develop into a triple double threat from the guard spot, similarly to a Josh Giddey or Ricky Rubio type player, and he could benefit from a situation where there are better shooters and more bigs around him than he’s had to work with as a Fr…He will likely be a lottery selection and among the 1st PGs to be picked in the 2023 Draft and could carve out a solid niche for himself if the team who selects him let’s him play to his strengths and doesn’t expect him to be a big-time scorer but more of a “do-it-all” type role player …
Notes:
Native of Duncanville, TX … Played at Duncanville where he helped the team knock off number one rated Monteverde  … Participated in the 2022 Chris Paul camp where he stood out as perhaps the best long term prospect … Measured 6′ 5.75” barefoot, 8′ 6.50” standing reach, 210 lbs and a 6′ 7.50” wingspan and a 32 inch standing vertical and a 39′ inch max vertical at the 2023 NBA Draft Combine …
Jorrye Nixon 2/10/23
Strengths:
6’7 combo guard … Good size and versatility for position. Can play on or off the ball. Natural feel for the game … Good athlete and very fluid. Quick off the floor and has no issue finishing above the rim jumping off one or both feet … Good ball-handler and keeps his dribble alive under pressure. Doesn’t over-dribble. Reads the floor well with good court vision and passing ability. Pushes the ball with either hand and leads well in transition. Finished 3
rd
in assists averaging 4.2 to 1.8 turnovers per game at the U18 Americas Championship in 2022 … Good rebounder for position. Averaged 7.8 (2 offensive) rebounds per game at the U18 Americas Championship in 2022 … Good tools, versatility, and intensity as a defender, showing ability to guard any perimeter position. Moves his feet well and disrupts the ball-handler. Covers more ground than he appears. Averaged a 3
rd
best 2 blocks per game at the U18 Americas Championship in 2022 … Can utilize mismatches, using his size against smaller guards or blowing by bigger defenders …
Weaknesses:
Handles contact pretty well but still has a lot of room to add strength … While it’s not a bad thing that he’s a selective driver and doesn’t force his impact on the offensive end, he doesn’t really break down the defense, even with his speed and ball-handling ability. Doesn’t typically slash to the basket until he finds that angle in the half-court or create a lot of scoring opportunities for himself … Can be more efficient as a shooter and scorer. Averaged 10.7 points per game on 42.1% FG% at the NBPA Top 100 in 2021 and 4.7 points per game on 32.4% FG% at the U18 Americas Championship in 2022 … More of a rhythm and streaky shooter than knock down, as he’s had events where he’s been a plus shooter from distance and other times he hasn’t been able to find his rhythm. Shot 35.7% 3PT% on 4.7 3PT attempts per game at the NBPA Top 100 in 2021 and 16.7 3PT% on 1 3PT attempt per game at the U18 Americas Championship in 2022 …
Outlook:
Incoming Arkansas freshman … 2022 McDonald’s All-American … Played in the 2022 Nike Hoop Summit … Recorded 11 points, 7 rebounds, and 5 assists in the 2022 Iverson Classic …
Evan Tomes 7/14/22  No one can fault Black for Arkansas' Sweet 16 exit as he had one of his best games of the season, showing vivid glimpses of what makes him one of the most versatile two-way prospects in this draft class.

On defense, he displayed intense ball pressure in the backcourt, fought over screens, recovered to protect the rim out of pick-and-roll, and generated plenty of deflections and steals with his instincts, toughness and energy.

Black was similarly aggressive on offense, something that hasn't always been the case this season, taking the ball strong to the rim and finishing with 11 free throw attempts. UConn's defense prevented him from showing off his passing, one of his best attributes, as his unselfishness passing in transition, finding the rolling big man rolling and skipping the ball to the opposite corner gives him significant potential as a big playmaker.

Black shot only 30% from 3 on the season, his biggest weakness, but it was encouraging to see him not shy away from open looks both pulling up off the dribble and in catch-and-shoot situations. Black does have some things teams can nitpick, but there's no denying he's an outstanding all-around player with an excellent feel for the game who brings significant competitiveness and winning intangibles that should allow him to have a fruitful NBA career.-- Jonathan Givony  With elite size for a guard, Black has the perfect build for the modern NBA. He’s a natural lead guard that can also play off ball on the wing. He’s the ideal prospect for the positionless game that the NBA is trending towards. Black is a player that relies more on skill than athleticism.
What makes Black special is his passing at 6-foot-7. He’s a great facilitator and can lead an effective offense. With that in mind, he needs to get better as a scorer to round out his offensive game. Regardless, tall playmakers are in high demand at the NBA level and he’s the type of player that would fit on nearly any team.
Many of the other top guards in this class are elite scorers. While Black can get his team a bucket, it's unclear whether he can be a top offensive option early in his NBA career. He’s more of a pass-first guard that prefers to set up his teammates. In fact, sometimes he’s so unselfish that it actually impacts him negatively.
The shooting for Black will be the swing skill that determines how high he’s selected in the 2023 NBA Draft. He was a respectable shooter from deep in his lone college season, but will need to become much more efficient moving forward. If the Arkansas freshman isn’t able to prove he can shoot if from deep in the pre-draft process, he may not go as high in the draft as he’d like. 
Defensively, Black’s versatility is intriguing. He’s able to defend up to three positions and is a good positional shot blocker. He gives effort and uses his length to be disruptive on that end of the floor. As such, he's one of the best guard defenders in this class.

It was interesting to see how Black played this season at Arkansas alongside three other potential first rounders in Nick Smith Jr., Jordan Walsh and Ricky Council. His role fluctuated quite a bit as Smith was in and out of the lineup. 
Overall, seeing Black increase his scoring output when Smith was off the floor was promising. Any team looking for a guard that can do a bit of everything on both ends will be interested in the 6-foot-7 guard in the lottery."
Bilal Coulibaly,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: OG Anunoby
Strengths:
Ultra athletic wing, with great size … Excellent length (wingspan measured at 7-3) … Had a late growth spurt, going from 5-11 to 6-6 without losing mobility and still growing … Has nice shoulders, that could fill up nicely … Smooth athlete … Very good feel for the game … Great leaping ability either off one foot or two feet … Likes to play above the rim … Has nice hangtime when he jumps, which helps him finish plays at the rim … Has big strides that help him cover a lot of ground … Runs the floor like a deer … Can even do some Eurosteps in transition … At his best in transition … Has an explosive first step that helps him attack closeouts … Loves to attack the rim whenever he has the chance … Already a really good slasher … Excels moving away off the ball and making timely cuts to the basket … Good looking shooting release … Has shown potential in Spot Up situations … Looked comfortable with the ball in his hands when he played at a lower level … Has shown some flashes as a secondary creator, with an intriguing Pull Up game … Draws fouls at a good rate … Very good rebounder for a wing, likes to crash the offensive boards … Can do an occasional coast to coast … Knows how to feel the lanes in transition … Elite defensive profile … A true pest on defense … Versatile, has the potential to guard 1-4 in the future … Switchable on the defensive end, takes advantage of his length, athleticism and basketball I.Q … Great lateral quickness … Has always active hands on the defensive end, making a lot of steals … Knows how to fill the passing lanes on defense … Good shot blocker for a wing … Good help defender … Has shown potential as a roam defender …
Weaknesses:
He needs to bulk up considerably to play at the next level and not be bullied by bigger wings … Despite his natural feel for the game, he is far from a finished project … He is still pretty raw offensively for a wing … Has problems when the game is slowing down … Has the tendency to disappear from the game at times and be too passive on offense … Can be a little indecisive with the ball in his hands … Doesn’t exactly have the ball on a string when dribbling, ball handling is still kind of loose and needs polishing … Does not handle the ball in traffic well … Shooting release varies from Pull Ups to Spot Up shots, needs consistency … His mid-range game is iffy at best … Can’t really create his own shot yet because of his ball handling limitations … Struggles on offense against physical defenders, who  pressure him … It would be good to improve his ball handling with his left hand … He mostly depends on his teammates to score, at least for now … Spot Up 3 is still a work in progress, needs reps to be consistent … Has the tendency to drive into traffic, which leads to bad passes … Can’t completely absorb contact yet on senior level, he needs to add muscle on his upper body … Decision making needs work, assist/turnover ratio is 1/1 … Bigger opponents can Post him up and either score or draw fouls from him … Has problems against physical, strong wings …
Overall:
Coulibaly is an athletic guard/forward with great size and length … Has made a meteoric rise over the past 12 months … He is by far the best wing defender of his generation in Europe and one of the best in this year’s class … Blessed with a great body and a good feel for the game, the French prospect has all the necessary tools to become an elite 3-and-D player, but it’s the potential that has shown in lower level as a secondary creator/Shot making wing that intrigues … With that said, despite all the promise he has shown, Coulibaly is still an iffy Spot Up shooter for now, who has long ways to go as a secondary ball handler and creator … If he manages to fulfill his promise, he could be something special. If not, he could still be a nice 3-and-D, slashing wing, the kind of player that teams in the NBA are all looking for …
Stefanos Makris 5/17/23  Coulibaly, whose parents are from Mali, stands 6-foot-8, 194 pounds with a 7-foot-2 wingspan. He is the third youngest player in the ESPN 100 at age 18 but is on a different trajectory from most prospects in this draft, being an almost complete unknown even in France a year ago after a late growth spurt that took him from 5-11 as a 16-year-old. Since last summer, Coulibaly has been on a steady ascent, having a strong showing with the French national team at the FIBA U18 European Championship and outdueling Bronny James in an exhibition game in Paris several weeks later in August by scoring 25 points, mostly in the second half, in a come-from-behind win. With his elite dimensions, Coulibaly's defensive potential is considerable, as he is regularly tasked with slowing down point guards and shows impressive quickness covering ground and contesting shots on the perimeter. Although not a consistent shooter, Coulibaly grew up a guard and retains many of those perimeter skills. -- Jonathan Givony  Coulibaly has long been known in scouting circles as one of the best European prospects in his age group. While he hadn’t played much with the senior team of Metropolitans 92 early in the season, he continued to improve and got his shot later on. As it relates to exposure, he had the luxury of NBA scouting departments being in town to watch Victor Wembanyama but also getting a glance at Coulibaly as well in these contests. With two-way potential and fantastic wing size, it makes sense why he’s a future NBA talent.
On the offensive end, he’s flashed the upside of being a guy who can lead team in scoring. He’s a smooth wing who is able to self-create, get to the rim and finish through contact at a good rate. It’s still early in his development and Coulibaly has very little high-level experience, but the flashes certainly make him a player worth tracking down for future drafts.
His natural feel for the game is impressive, especially at his age. He's also a very good athlete that uses his length and pop well. 
On the flip side, he’s also showcased some impressive defensive tools that should translate to the NBA game. He's got a long way to go from a physical standpoint, but he should naturally get bigger and stronger as the years go on.
After being great in the U21 league, Coulibaly made the most of his senior team reps which has catapulted him into lottery conversations. He's bow grown to 6-foot-8 and was a key contributor in Mets 92's deep postseason run."
Jarace Walker,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Tim Thomas
Strengths:
6’8 versatile forward/small ball five-man with a desirable modern skill set … Good length with a 7’2 wingspan … Filled out body frame with grown man strength. Plays well through contact and uses his body well … Very good mobility and athleticism. Effortless off the ground and doesn’t take a lot of time to load up when finishing, rebounding, or blocking shots … Good hands … Scores well inside/out and in iso situations. Rare combination of strength/power and finesse with soft touch scoring inside. Good pick and roll/pop potential. Shows a fadeaway and ability to score in the post … Scoring stats: 12.4 PPG 46.2% FG% Under Armour Association 2019, 10.6 PPG 56.3% FG% NBPA Top 100 2021, 5th best 16.7 PPG 2nd best 66% FG% NIBC 2021-22 … Shoots well from 3PT with good rotation coming out of his hand and high arc.

Shot 84.8% FT% Under Armour Association 2019, 4th best 87.5% FT% NBPA Top 100 2021, 76.1% FT% NIBC 2021-22 … Good rebounder, pulls down with two hands and usually wins the battle if someone else has a hand on it. Can take a defensive rebound to the other end and start the offense. Averaged a 5th best 5.6 rebounds per game at the NBPA Top 100 in 2021 and a 2nd best 8.2 (2.4 offensive) rebounds per game over the NIBC in 2021-22 … Handles the ball well for his size with either hand and can push up the floor. Solid ability changing speed and direction with the ball. Moves well and shifty/swift with the ball for his size … Good court vision and passing ability in the half-court, post, or mid-drive.

Averaged 3.5 assists per game over the NIBC in 2021-22 … Versatile defensively and good shot blocker. Averaged a 2nd best 2.2 blocks per game over the NIBC in 2021-22 … Sees the big picture on both ends and understands the roles/personnel of each individual on the court … Impacts the game in multiple areas …
Weaknesses:
While versatile, he doesn’t have great lateral quickness when defending on the perimeter and he’s bit stiff in the hips … Can tighten up as a ball-handler, as he can get loose when making moves … Can still polish up as a finisher as he has a tendency to duck his way to the basket without a plan to eventually put a shot up. While it can work at this level, he’ll need to expand his offense a bit more as he progresses, and opponents match his size/strength and other gifts … Can add consistency to jump shot and speed up release. While the foundation is there, he isn’t a consistent threat stretching the floor yet. Shot 30.8% 3PT% on 1.3 3PT attempts per game over the NIBC in 2021-22 …
Outlook:
Incoming Houston freshman … Recorded 11 points (5-10 FG), 7 rebounds, 4 assists, and 3 steals in the 2022 McDonald’s All-American … Played in the 2022 Nike Hoop Summit … Named to the 2022 Iverson Classic …
Evan Tomes 7/22/22
Notes:
Measured 6′ 6.50” barefoot, 8′ 8.50” standing reach, 248.6 lbs and a 7′ 2.50” wingspan and a 34.5 inch standing vertical and a 38′ inch max vertical at the 2023 NBA Draft Combine …  NBA scouts love that Walker elected to play at Houston under a demanding coach such as Kelvin Sampson, who doesn't typically reel in five-star recruits, showing that Walker isn't afraid to get pushed. He has had a productive season but still has some questions to answer regarding the extent of his skill level and just how high his ceiling is as an offensive player, something the NCAA tournament can hopefully shed light on.

Walker's tremendous frame, length, defensive versatility and toughness give him a ready-made role he can step into early in his NBA career. He has shown progress this season with his perimeter shooting (36% from 3) but has been a mixed bag as a decision-maker and a shot-creator, all while shooting a disappointing 62% from the free throw line. After Walker has been tucked away in the American Athletic Conference, NBA executives will appreciate being able to watch him against a different caliber of competition in the NCAA tournament, as Houston hasn't played a top-25 opponent in more than three months.-- Jonathan Givony  In terms of having a frame that’s NBA ready, Walker is near the top of the list in this class. He’s a strong, physical forward with a high motor that can impact the game on both ends. He entered his freshman season as a first-round talent, but then emerged as one of the best prospects in this entire class.
Not only does he have great positional height, but Walker’s wingspan is over 7-foot-2 at this point. He’s disruptive on defense, blocking a ton of shots and generating turnovers. It’s not just his length that helps him defensively, he’s also got a great natural feel on that end of the floor. Walker’s defensive instincts should translate well as he continues to progress in his basketball career.
What’s most impressive about Walker is how versatile and aware of his role that he is. He’s proven to be effective playing whatever role the team needs and doing whatever sets them up to win. Players that are moldable and self aware often find success as they’re able to fit into many lineups and rotations.
Offensively, Walker loves to operate in the mid-post. Once he catches the ball, he’s got a variety of moves he can use as he faces up. Whether it’s getting to the rim or shooting from the midrange, the 6-foot-8 forward is effective. Walker loves the turnaround fade shot from 15 feet away, which has turned into one of his go-to looks.
While it was unclear how his jumper would translate at the college level, he was effective in the midrange and beyond the arc, which is one of the reasons his draft stock has skyrocketed. The release itself is somewhat slow, but given he's a forward with time to improve on that front means there's not reason for concern.
Although he’s physically gifted and very athletic, he'll need to improve his handle if he wants to be a more perimeter oriented player moving forward. The ability to operate on the wing will be a swing factor as it relates to his future draft positioning. 
Regardless, Walker is an extremely powerful prospect and an effective scorer. He makes the most of every offensive opportunity and shoots a very high percentage from the floor. Teams love shot blocking forwards that don’t need the ball in their hands every play to make an impact. Walker fits that mold, thriving as a player that helps his team win with plays that don’t show up on the stat sheet. One thing that sticks out positively for Walker is his ability to hit teammates in stride with long outlet passes in transition.
He’ll be one of the most physically ready rookies in the league next season and shouldn’t have any problem playing from day one. Walker projects to be a high upside defender that fits the modern style of play. He moves his feet extremely well for his size, blending quickness and strength on that end of the floor. 
The talented forward was injured most of his junior year of high school, but bounced back last season as a senior and emerged as one of the top players in the country.
On a loaded roster at IMG Academy, Walker played with four other ESPN Top 100 prospects in Keyonte George (Baylor), Jaden Bradley (Alabama), Jett Howard (Michigan) and A.J. Storr (St. John’s). Walker spent all four of his high school years at IMG, playing many roles along the way and is used to being on the big stage
Walker is truly built like a football player, and was actually recruited by the football coaches at IMG to become a two-sport athlete. He has the ability to bully opposing players on the court and uses his strength in many situations."
Taylor Hendricks,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Pascal Siakam
Strengths:
Hendricks is a slender 6’9 215 PF/C prospect who has a good combination of size, mobility and athleticism to fit in different roles in the frontcourt … Has some versatility offensively, and has the potential to put up solid scoring production (15 ppg on nearly 48 FG%) without having to dominate the ball.. Finishes above the rim often and with good explosion & power, and shows promise converting through contact despite his thin frame (52 FG% inside the arc) … More of a face-up player than a true post-up guy, and has enough quickness to beat bigger players off the bounce with his 1st step … Decisive, unselfish decision-maker who takes what the defense gives him when it’s time to score or as a passer (1.4/1.4 A/TO) … Equipped with a soft touch and range out to the 3-point line (39 3FG% on over 4 3FGA), and is a knockdown shooter with his feet set particularly in and around the corners … Shouldn’t have many problems getting his shots off with his height and high release point … Not bad in the mid-post area either, and shows flashes of a turnaround jumper over his left shoulder … Can also extend and score over smaller forwards in the low post with his right-hand jump hook … Has good hands and a seemingly wide catch radius to snag inaccurate passes … Active player who competes hard and makes hustle plays; will work to get himself some easy points by cutting off the ball and crashing the offensive glass (2.4 ORPG) … Has potential as a screen-and-roll threat … Runs the floor like a deer and it’s easy to project him being an asset as a rim running scoring threat in transition … Has been outstanding defensively as a Fr., particularly off the ball, showing excellent overall instincts and timing as a rim protector (1.7 BPG) … Must be located by offensive players when slashing to the paint … Pretty rangy and can cover ground quickly to rotate and erase if his teammates get beat … Also does a really good job of positioning his arms straight up and keeping the shots he blocks in play, even when he makes emphatic rejections … Moves his feet well laterally and projects to be able to switch and guard on the perimeter nicely too; his size and timing at the point of attack was often bothersome for smaller players to try to shoot over at the college level…Active hands to deflects passes (1 spg) … Pretty good from the charity stripe (78 FT% on over 3 FTA) … Fits the bill as a modern frontcourt player with his 2-way ability and versatile skill set … A blossoming player who greatly exceeded expectations as a Fr., showing good consistency and becoming more assertive offensively as his season went along …
Weaknesses:
Will need to add more muscle to his frame, especially if he wants to establish his low post game with more consistency … Couldn’t consistently establish post position in the AAC so it would be difficult for that to translate at the NBA level without getting stronger … Not much of a shot-creator offensively; ball-handling needs tuning up and he usually needs others to get him the ball to produce … Was seen as a combo forward offensively early on, especially in HS, but is a work in progress as a creator on the perimeter and seems to project as more of a PF who can play as a small ball C in a pinch now … Not an especially creative offensive player; can struggle if you take away the things he wants to do and make him a playmaker which could limit his upside as a scorer at the NBA level…Doesn’t create much space off the dribble and is a straight-line slasher almost exclusively…Adequate rebounder in his area, but not quite as good on the glass defensively as he is on the offensive end (4.6 DRPG, 7 RPG overall), especially considering some of his physical/athletic tools …
Overall:
Hendricks is a Fr. who was a 4-star recruit out of southern Florida that picked Johnny Dawkins and UCF over some of the bigger in-state programs in the 2022 recruiting cycle…He was an immediate impact player in the AAC and among the very best Fr across the nation for a UCF team that started the season strong but ended up being an NIT team…Still, his production and physicals tools caught the eyes of numerous NBA scouts and execs as an outstanding, switchable defensive player who can match anywhere in the frontcourt and as a nice 3-point shooter and angry finisher at the rim to boot…He’s not polished on offense yet though, and needs to fine tune his shot-creating skills to play more as a SF as well as adding the physical strength to play more than spot minutes at the C spot…Still there is plenty to like about Hendricks, who should be able to earn minutes sooner or later given his versatility, shooting touch, athleticism and defensive acumen…He’s also a smart player with natural instincts and timing that you can’t always teach and he has played well enough that he should be in discussion to be a lottery pick in the 2023 Draft ..
Notes:
Measured 6′ 8.25” barefoot, 8′ 11.00” standing reach, 213.6 lbs and a 7′ 0.50” wingspan and a 32.5 inch standing vertical and a 36′ inch max vertical at the 2023 NBA Draft Combine …
Jorrye Nixon 3/23/23  UCF showed some early promise but ultimately faded, finished 8-10 in AAC play and fell to the No. 7 seed in the AAC conference tournament. It now faces the daunting task of winning four games in four days to prolong its season. It's tough to lay much blame for that on Hendricks, who has been easily one of the most productive (and consistent) freshmen in college basketball, giving him a clear case for lottery consideration as an explosive, energetic, 6-9 multipositional defender who is shooting 42% from 3.  Unlike some surprise under-the-radar underclassmen, Hendricks' productivity only increased as the season moved on, even against better competition that he mostly excelled against. Finishing on a strong note would be helpful, as a handful of executives might be getting their first live look at Hendricks this weekend, but his body of work is strong after 30 games. -- Jonathan Givony
 Perhaps the biggest riser at the college level this season, Hendricks has drastically outperformed his freshman expectations. Standing at 6-foot-9, he’s a knockdown shooter from deep and also disruptive on defense.
The perimeter shooting is what we’ll need to keep an eye on. He started the college season out on fire from deep, did regress some as the season went on. Even then, he finished the season just under 40% from beyond the arc on high volume for a forward. Now that we know the shot is real, he has more of an opportunity to play what we’d traditionally consider a combo forward at the next level, which unlocks his ability to slot into NBA rotations. 
One small concern about Hendricks is his ability to self-create. He’s shown flashes of that, but hasn’t yet shown he could be a top scoring option at the next level without being created for. He’s also too passive at times, sometimes going long stretches without scoring the ball. Aggressiveness is something he’s indicated he’s working on, but we’ll need to see more of it in the pre-draft process.
On the defensive end, his versatility pops. Whether he’s guarding a quicker wing or a bigger center, Hendricks has proven to be effective. His lateral quickness and footwork still have room to improve, but he’s got the early makings of a really disruptive defender. In fact, there's a case to be made he has some of the highest defensive upside of any forward in this class.
In the modern NBA, playing multiple positions generally results in more time on the court. Hendricks having the ability to play three could result in him getting on the court quite a bit as a rookie.
A four-star recruit, the 6-foot-9 forward had offers from larger schools across most major conferences, but ultimately chose UCF due to the proximity to his home in South Florida and the family feel of the organization. It was a great choice for him, as he went from a prospect that likely would need multiple seasons at the college level to a clear one-and-one lottery pick.
Hendricks was one of the best freshman in the country and has the perfect build of a modern combo forward. He plays alongside his twin brother, Tyler Hendricks, who plays guard for UCF.
Many players that aren’t at the bigger schools are critiqued for the level of competition they go up against, but the Knights played a solid non-conference schedule this season. The range for Hendricks feels wide, with his upside being as high as sixth or seventh, but also a chance to fall just outside the lottery depending on how things shake up.
Hendricks’ pre-draft process will be huge for where he lands. All it takes is one team to value his skillset to go much earlier than even expected at the end of the season."
Cason Wallace,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Immanuel Quickley/Marcus Smart
Strengths:
Wallace may very well be the most physical perimeter defender in the draft this year … At 6’4”, he has a compact frame that despite being around 195 pounds, should be able to add weight and muscle  … Plays a hard-nosed style, especially on defense and does not back down from opponents … Plays passing lanes extremely well and has active hands defensively without letting himself get out of position in order to try to create turnovers … Averaged nearly 2 steals per game in college … Is able to get hands on the ball on opponent drives to disrupt drives to the rim … Stays out of foul trouble pretty well for someone that generally defends the opposing team’s best guard … Is an excellent chase down guy in transition, never gives up on plays and creates a lot of misses by contesting everything … Is a capable rebounder when given the freedom to chase them down, recording 9 in his final game … Is a really good spot up shooter on offense, and does a really good job of relocating after passing to find open spots … Shot 34.6% on threes in college, but a much higher percentage on catch and shoot opportunities … Developed a reputation for being an excellent outside shooter at the high school level … Has a solid runner/floater game, allowing him to score without having to get all the way to the rim … Elevates well for dunks in transition, even on drop steps, showing solid athleticism … Shooting ability is better than he was able to show at UK, making him a potential sleeper for the next level as a scoring combo guard …
Weaknesses:
Productivity (11.7 ppg)  and efficiency (34.6 3P%) were not great for such a talented player … Athleticism didn’t pop the same in Lexington as it did in high school … Struggles some when the offense runs through him, not a high volume scorer … While he shoots well off of catch and shoot, he doesn’t seem as natural creating his own three point shot opportunities … Doesn’t get to the free throw line as much as you would like, and can struggle a bit from the line at times (though 76% from the line is sold) … Can be a willing ball mover, but will not pass his teammates open … He is the epitome of a combo guard right now, and needs to further develop his offensive game to play the point full time at the next level … Can be easy to read: prefers to attack the rim strong when driving to his left, but is much easier to influence to a weak finish or pass out when driving to his right … If a defender can cut off his right hand drive, he will generally look to pass out and then relocate … Will need to diversify his offensive attack, as his bag isn’t super deep at this moment … Battled a back injury during his time at Kentucky which left him looking less explosive than he did in high school. Teams will need to evaluate if the back is a long term concern …
Overall:
Cason Wallace projects as a player that should be a solid piece and could be a terrific three-and-D player that will benefit from the additional spacing provided to him at the next level … Teams that consider drafting him will need to realize that he’s closer to Marcus Smart than a traditional point guard, but the things he does defensively could end up being elite, and with his shooting and finishing, is not a liability on the offensive end … He will benefit from playing with another ball handler, especially early on in his development … If his back injury doesn’t derail his development, he could be an extremely valuable piece to a team in the late lottery, top 20 range of the draft …
Notes:
Measured 6′ 2.50” barefoot, 8′ 5.00” standing reach, 195.2 lbs and a 6′ 8.50” wingspan and a 28 inch standing vertical and a 36′ inch max vertical at the 2023 NBA Draft Combine …

Outlook:
Incoming Kentucky freshman … 2022 McDonald’s All-American … Scored 15 points and recorded 3 steals in the 2022 Jordan Brand Classic … Scored 13 points and passed out 6 assists in the 2022 Iverson Classic …
Evan Tomes 7/13/22  Kentucky's season ended in disappointment in a hard-fought loss to Kansas State, but it's hard to blame their star freshman point guard. Wallace had 21 points on 9-for-11 shooting with seven rebounds, four assists and two steals.

Wallace was a perfect 7-for-7 (15 points) in the second half, coming up repeatedly with big baskets and almost always making the right play passing ahead, driving and dishing and looking under control. He was unlucky to see his teammates go 3-for-19 from 3, with at least six open 3-point looks created by Wallace that weren't converted, a major reason Kentucky lost.

Wallace's shot creation and aggressiveness left something to be desired at times this season, but he was able to get inside the paint against Kansas State in transition and out of pick and roll, hitting tough floaters and layups through contact going both left or right. He committed four turnovers in the first 10 minutes, partially a product of trying to navigate Kentucky's lack of spacing, but played a pretty clean game otherwise.

His defense, long considered his calling card, was vividly evident Sunday, as he came up with two pick-six steals for layups, fought over screens aggressively and had some big-time rebounds in traffic while putting his body on the line.

Wallace will be disappointed not to advance past the first round of the NCAA tournament and there are some holes that can be nitpicked in his game with his lack of scoring production and his occasional struggles with efficiency. However, Wallace had a strong freshman year that will serve him well developmentally after being forced to shoulder a huge offensive load under extreme pressure for much of the season and now looks like a strong top-10 prospect. -- Jonathan Givony  When it comes to well-rounded prospects, look no further than Wallace. He does nearly everything well, making it hard to define clear weaknesses. He’s certainly not elite at everything, but he impacts the game at so many levels.
This makes him one of the best two-way guards in this class. His defensive upside is what will result in him likely being selected in the lottery. Wallace is elite on that end of the floor.
Offensively, Wallace is a combo guard that’s proven to be effective on and off the ball. He shoots it well from deep and has quite a bit of range. His jumper is quick, fluid and consistent, but that doesn’t mean he still can’t improve as a perimeter scorer.
Wallace doesn’t take a ton of highly difficult triples, as he prefers to be square and in rhythm. At the next level, those types of shots are hard to come by, so he’ll need to become a better shot maker on all fronts.
He’s a shifty driver, and solid handler of the ball. Wallace uses his strength and good use of angles to create space. The Kentucky prospect embraces contact and does well with physicality. Wallace is a good playmaker that enjoys setting up his teammates and generated a high number of assists as a freshman in a tough conference.
He’s by no means the jumbo guard we see across the NBA landscape, but the 6-foot-4 playmaker is strong and disciplined, which makes up for it. For a guard, Wallace is a solid rebounder. That’s something that sticks out when watching him play, as he gives effort and always is trying to get his hands on the ball.
As previously mentioned, Wallace is one of the best defenders in this upcoming draft class, and arguably the best on-ball prospect. He takes defense personally and wants to lock down whoever is in front of him. With his frame, Wallace can guard three positions at a high level. He stays low to the ground, moves his feet well, and makes the right reads. His hands are also lightning quick.
Overall, Wallace projects to be the ultimate 3-and-D guard and a highly impactful complimentary piece at the NBA level. He’s a rare defensive playmaker that won’t be the flashy contributor, but will always have an influence on winning. He’s one of the biggest competitors in this class and wants to win at all costs.
What’s perhaps most underrated about Wallace is his understanding of how to get the most out of those around him and enhance their strengths. Simply put, he makes the guys around him better on both ends.
As a senior at Richardson High School, Wallace led a squad that was considered the best team in the country down the stretch of the season. He was 2021-22 Texas Boys Basketball Gatorade Player of the Year and played in all of the big recruiting events after graduation."
Jett Howard,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Doug McDermott
Strengths:
Howard is a physically gifted swingman who stands a legitimate 6’8 215 with a good frame that should have little problems matching up on the wing at the pro level … Floor spacer; likes to shoot the ball from the perimeter and is promising at doing so (35 3FG% on a healthy 7.3 attempts per game in the regular season as a Fr.) with his confidence, range and touch … Has a high and compact shot release that looks good leaving his hands more often than not … Moves well without the ball and can be dangerous hitting shots when navigating screens and handoffs … Also has shown the ability to use subtle stepback and jab step moves off the dribble to free himself to create space for deep shots … Has proven to be an effective shooter from the mid-range area as well, whether going downhill for pull-ups after being chased off the line or utilizing runners … Possesses a good feel for knowing when to pass or shoot; plays patient, shows solid floor vision and generally takes what the defense gives him … Effective pick and roll player who prefers to shoot as opposed to attacking the paint, but also can use the attention he gets as a shooter to open passing lanes for his teammates out of ball-screen action (2.0 apg) … Shows flashes of a post game that he would be wise to continue to develop; as he has the size and touch to wall off and score against smaller perimeter matchups in the mid to high post area…Good FT shooter when he gets to the line (80% as a Fr.) … High IQ, well-coached player who takes care of the ball and plays to his strengths (1.3 topg)…Strong bloodlines as his father (and current head coach) Juwan Howard played in the NBA for 19 years …
Weaknesses:
Howard lacks much in the way of athleticism and explosiveness … Doesn’t seem to have much length and his physical profile will be worth monitoring closely during the pre-draft process to determine his athletic upside as well … Won’t strike fear in NBA defenders off the dribble, particularly in isolation, and usually needs a ball-screen and a running start to generate the momentum to get downhill into the paint … Doesn’t get all the way to the paint much at all, and struggles mightily with finishing for a 6’8 player when he does get there (only 42 FG% inside the arc) … Not to be confused with an above the rim player, especially in halfcourt offense…Not a crude ball-handler but is typically more effective the less he dribbles…Only 2.7 FTA a game, illustrating his tendency to shoot rather than aggressively slash … Hit the proverbial “freshman wall” in conference play; teams notably picked up on his tendency to favor going right, started forcing him to go to his off-hand more often and his effectiveness and efficiency decreased as his Fr season unfolded … Needs improvement defensively after often being targeted in both on and off-ball actions as a Fr … Below average lateral quickness, and doesn’t contain penetration that well when isolated … Has the potential to be somewhat switchable as a defender, but has struggled at times with both the more athletic wings he matches up with and the stronger PFs he sometimes will have to face as a smallball type PF … Doesn’t make many splash plays defensively either, with paltry steal and block totals (0.4 spg & 0.7 bpg)…Poor rebounding numbers (2.8 rpg); much more prone to leaking out to the perimeter in transition than chipping in on the glass
Overall:
Jett Howard was a top 50 level recruit who came to Michigan after a standout career in the Florida HS and AAU circuit … He came out blazing as a Fr. and impressed with his combination of shooting, passing, IQ and pick and roll prowess immediately … Flashes impressive moments as a shot-maker, being able to drain shots in a variety of ways and with easy NBA range … He also makes plenty of good passes with timing when teams load up to slow the threat of him shooting in the screening game, whether to rolling big guys or players located on the perimeter for jumpers…Still, he has some holes in his game that limit him, particularly on defense where he is rather heavy-footed and around the rim with his lack of athletic ability…He also had a lackluster last few weeks of his season that magnified just how much improvement he needs to make to be an efficient offensive player… But he does have some worthwhile floor skills that will make him a good fit as a role player and floor spacer at the NBA level, and he seems to have the basketball acumen to figure it out…He has played himself pretty firmly in 1st round discussion just before the season has ended, but he could elect to return and strengthen his draft stock with another year playing for his Dad …
Jorrye Nixon 3/14/23  Two Big Ten tournament wins over Rutgers and Purdue on Thursday and Friday seem to be needed to give Michigan any hope of earning a spot in the NCAA tournament.

Howard, in particular, could benefit from a strong end to the season to solidify his standing with NBA teams, as he has struggled at times in Big Ten action, shooting just 42% from 2-point range in 17 conference games while not bringing enough as a rebounder or defender to compensate for his inability to create efficient offense inside the arc.

Howard has still flashed what makes him an intriguing NBA prospect as a 6-8 wing with dynamic shooting ability and range, ability to pull up off the dribble and impressive vision passing on the move, but he has been somewhat passive inserting himself into games. His exceptionally poor playmaking numbers defensively (0.5 steals, 0.9 blocks, 3.6 rebounds per 40) are certain to hurt him with NBA analytics models. Some teams wonder, however, whether he will return to school for his sophomore season considering his father, Juwan, is his coach and he wasn't initially considered a one-and-done candidate. Missing the NCAA tournament could accelerate that process, and potentially cause teammates Bufkin and Hunter Dickinson to consider doing the same. -- Jonathan Givony  Jett Howard, son of Michigan head coach Juwan Howard, was one of the most fun stories of the college season playing under his father. He’s a jumbo guard that can also play either forward position.
A projected 3-and-D prospect, Howard is extremely versatile on both ends of the floor. He’s got a good balance of size, defensive upside and shooting touch that should translate well at the next level. He’s really not an elite athlete but has an NBA build already.
Especially in spot up situations, Howard is an elite shooter. Like many young prospects, he does dip the ball down during his shooting motion, but there’s still time to fix that. If he able to learn to catch in the shooting pocket and immediately start the upward motion of his shot, he could be even more of a deadly shooter at the NBA level.
On drives, the Michigan wing has great footwork. Since he doesn’t have blow by speed or the ability to overpower defenders, he’s crafty and methodical with his moves getting to the paint. Howard also isn’t an elite ball handler, but that’s fine considering he doesn’t project to be a primary facilitator anyway. He’s a bit loose with the ball, which hasn’t been a glaring issue to this point, but at the next level could arise as a problem.
One underrated part of Howard’s game is the ability to push tempo. He’s always got his head up looking to start the break and is a great outlet passer.
Outside of his shot, Howard is most known for defensive upside. He’s great at the point of attack and is also good at navigating the pick-and-roll. He’s got the size, length and lateral quickness to defend upwards of four positions. Overall, he really understands the importance of defense and could end up being one of the better defenders in the country this season.

Howard obviously has NBA pedigree given who his father and coach is, which is likely why he’s such a smart player. You can tell he’s been around the game his entire life and has been coached well.
Part of an elite high school team at IMG Academy, Howard played his senior season with Keyonte George (Baylor) and Jarace Walker (Houston) who should both go in the lottery of the 2023 NBA Draft. Howard improved as the his senior season went on last year, capping off his high school campaign as MVP of the Iverson Classic.
On an experienced Michigan team that did underperform, Howard was a primary scoring option and one of the best shooters for his size in the country. He could be a player that impacts the game immediately at the next level."
Dereck Lively,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Jaxson Hayes/Willie Cauley-Stein
Strengths:
One of the best rim protectors in college basketball with his size, length and athleticism around the paint … On top of his physical characteristics, he’s got solid anticipation and natural shot blocking instincts … Has an exceptionally high block rate for his minutes played … Runs the break well and is great at rim running and catching ally oop lobs … Mobile and agile enough to roam the interior without racking up three-second calls at the next level … Disciplined pick-and-roll defender who is terrific in drop coverage … Gets excellent positioning as an offensive rebounder by following the play and finding the open space for putback dunks … Didn’t shoot a high percentage, but looks comfortable letting it fly from the perimeter, indicating that shooting and scoring could be a surprising element if incorporated positively into his game at the next level … His usage rate may have been low, but Lively took care of the ball, turning it over just over once per 40 minutes … A 72% shooter from inside the arc …  If he can get his offensive game to the point where he can make open shots and score within the flow, he could be a valuable big due to his defensive and athletic abilities … Defensively, makes up ground in a flash with long strides and long arms on these switches … Shooting motion looks solid. He needs to be able to shoot it with better pace and get it off cleanly in game speed, which will take time, but the mechanics are solid enough to give his shot and ability to improve offensively some intrigue …
Weaknesses:
Just 5.2 ppg in his freshman season on 15% from 3 and 60% FT shooter, not exactly numbers that instill confidence about his ability to contribute much offensively during his rookie contract … Doesn’t have the greatest lateral quickness, but can switch on screens on the perimeter  … He may struggle to stay on the floor at the end of games when teams look to mismatch him with pick and pop shooters … Didn’t show much in his freshman season as a back to the basket scorer with a rarely utilized hook shot and a lean frame … Still needs to fill out and put on muscle … Failed to earn consistent minutes early in the season and often found himself in foul trouble when he did get into the game … Averaged 2.7 fouls in just 20 minutes per game showing his struggles to stay on the court … Gets displaced under the basket often because of his lack of strength … Extremely low free-throw rate for someone with such a size advantage over his opponents with just one attempt per game … Only shot 60% in those attempts … Didn’t dominate as much as he should have on the glass with just five rebounds per game, but it’s hard to imagine those numbers not improving in time as he adds strength … Lack of rebounding brings up some toughness questions, so teams will obviously need to feel comfortable with this element of his game and that he can improve it … Feel for the game a work in progress … Not always that great at anticipating plays on the offensive end, can get better with his hands, catching the ball cleanly and making a polished offensive move … Has a long ways to go as a creator, offensively …
Overall:
Lively was rated by ESPN’s recruiting analysts as the top overall senior coming into the season, but his lack of overall production, polish and lean body type means he could really use an additional year in college, refining his skills and growing more comfortable on the perimeter as a shooter … Flashed nice potential against North Carolina in his “breakout’ 4 point, 8 block, 14 rebound game during his freshman campaign, which earned him a great deal of draft hype …
Notes:
All-ACC Defensive and Freshman Team … Five-star center ranked as top high school recruit by ESPN in 2022 … Pennsylvania Gatorade Player of the Year in 2022 … 2022 McDonald’s All-American …
Derek Bast 5/15/23  Lively scored just four points in 65 minutes of NCAA tournament action, failing to attempt a single shot against Tennessee. That's partially due to his limitations offensively as well as Duke's own struggles with ball movement versus a stout Vols defense.

Sporting the lowest usage percentage (11.6%) of any collegiate player in our top 100, with what would be the lowest usage rate of a draft pick in the past 20-plus years, Lively doesn't have much to offer outside of being spoon-fed dunks at just 5.2 PPG.

He does bring exceptional mobility covering ground on the perimeter and instincts as a rim-protector with his 7-3 1/2 wingspan and 9-4 standing reach. He's the No. 1 shot-blocker among projected draft picks by a wide margin and has improved his ability to show or switch on ball-screens, giving him a ready-made role in the NBA with room to grow as his frame fills out. Lively is a project offensively and will need to improve his strength and physicality to hold his own on both ends of the floor. But he is only 19 years old, has improved all season and has the type of upside a patient team could certainly be interested in developing should he enter the draft.-- Jonathan Givony  After being ranked as the top player in his high school class, Lively had big expectations as a freshman at Duke. He’s a great athlete with incredible size, with the upside to be one of the most impactful defenders in the NBA at some point, which is why he was rated so highly coming into college.
Lively is a smooth center that’s very springy. He’s a huge lob threat and good rim runner that also is effective in the pick-and-roll. Late in his high school career, Lively expanded his game to fit the modern NBA and started to knock down shots from beyond the arc. While he typically attempts those shots from the top of the key or corner, he’s continuing to become more reliable as a shooter from deep overall. He’s still got a long way to go, but defenses at least have to respect his shot when he catches on the perimeter.
When he’s not shooting from outside, the Duke freshman dunks nearly everything. With that in mind, he’s got great touch and can use both hands well around the rim. Like many centers, he’s not a guy you run your offense through but is a complimentary piece on that end. 
Lively has improved as an offensive prospect over the past few years, but wasn't all that assertive at Duke this season. That's the biggest question mark for him, as that side of the ball left a lot to be desired. Can he emerge as a player that can truly be dominant on both ends?
On the defensive side of the ball, the 7-footer is incredible. He’s a great rim protector that has natural feel and good instincts as it relates to blocking shots. He can truly change the game on the defensive end, which we saw numerous times during his freshman season.
He’s arguably the best defender in this class as a rim protector, but there are things he can still improve upon. Most notably, due to his slender frame Lively struggles one-one-one against bigger, more physical centers. He’ll need to get stronger this season before making the jump to the NBA.
On the flip side, he’s special relative to true centers as it relates to defending smaller guys on the perimeter. It’s pretty rare to see a 7-footer that isn’t a liability taking on guards that far from the rim. Lively’s ability to defend outside of the paint allows his team to switch anything.
It was fascinating to see Lively at Duke this season alongside another first-round talent in freshman Kyle Filipowski. Whether it ended up being good or bad for his long-term outlook, seeing him play alongside another 7-footer at times resulted in interesting data points. 
Lively was a member of the 2022 USA Nike Hoop Summit Team that beat the World Select Team. He was also the 2022 Gatorade Pennsylvania Boys Basketball Player of the Year. His mother played basketball at Penn State before going professional overseas. She’s also spent quite a bit of time coaching, which is likely another reason Lively is such a smart player. 
Due to his age and defensive upside, Lively will be taken in the first round even if he had an underwhelming overall season. He could be a project that pays off for a team in a big way."
Gradey Dick,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Gordon Hayward
Strengths:
Has good size on the wing at 6’8 205, with the frame to easily put on around 10-15 lbs of muscle … Adequate athleticism with room to gain more explosiveness as he gets stronger … A knockdown shooter from distance who lets it fly with confidence (42 3FG% one over 5 attempts per game); possesses a high and compact release that holds up well when spotting up or off screens and hand offs … Steps into his shots and rises up with good elevation, allowing him to not be as phased by contested jumpers … Your man if you need a corner 3-pointer … Moves well without the ball; knows how to navigate to open spots whether for a deep shot on the move or a timely cut towards the basket as a drive and dish valve … Can stick 1 dribble pull-ups with ease when he gets a step after attacking closeouts … Doesn’t waste movement and is generally concise with what he wants to do on the court … Projects to be more of a floor spacer and shooting valve in transition at the next level, but he has been a factor making his way to the rim at Kansas, showing his underrated leaping ability when he has momentum going towards the basket with some above the rim flashes when he has daylight … Tilts the defense a bit with the threat of his shooting and makes it easier for his teammates to operate from the foul line extended down to the paint without as much help from sagging defenders … Will pressure the rim via backdoor cuts when the defense plays him overly close on the perimeter, and has been more willing to play through contact in the paint than he’s given credit for … Ball doesn’t stick to him for long; mostly shoots but also makes unselfish plays within the flow of the offense…Low turnover rate for a Fr. (1.3 topg); generally takes care of the ball and makes sound decisions … Chips in on the glass for a Jayhawks team that plays small lineups most times (5 rpg) … Projects to be able to match up with either wing position on most nights at the pro level … A steady defender at the point of attack, consistently plays with effort and gets down in his stance … Also shows active hands and awareness defensively (1.5 spg), constantly stripping the ball away from unexpecting slashers and reaching in the passing lanes to get a hand on lazy passes that occasionally lead to live ball turnovers and runouts … Knows his roles and responsibilities, and plays them with maturity beyond his years at this stage
Weaknesses:
Not an Elite athlete by NBA standards; not particularly fast or quick … Also lacks length, though his anticipatory skills help alleviate it defensively off the ball he likely won’t effect that many shot attempts when contesting because of it … Not afraid of contact but still needs to get stronger; sometimes can be washed out of plays by getting hung up going under screens and taking too long to get around to stick to the person he’s guarding … Quicker matchups can at times beat him off the bounce and get him on their hip to create slashing lanes to the rim or pick up foul calls … Heavily reliant on timing to offset his length and quickness deficiencies, may not be able to recover and get back into position the times he whiffs on his gambles for steals at the next level … Nothing more than ordinary off the bounce; ho-hum ball-handler who offers nothing more than straight-line slashes & basic 1-2 dribble pullups … Doesn’t show the ability to create much space for himself off the dribble … Will occasionally pick up charging calls the more he dribbles, at times barreling into the lane without a plan…Doesnt project to finish well in the paint amongst the trees at the next level, particularly against set halfcourt defenses … Has solid feel for the game for a player his age, but is still learning how to pick his spots…Good FT shooter (84 FT% as a Fr), but doesn’t get to the line that often (2.8 FTA per game) …
Overall:
Gradey Dick was the 2022 Gatorade National Player of the Year in HS and a McDonalds All-American who came to defending national champs Kansas as the crown jewel of their recruiting class … Bill Self thinks that he could arguably be the best shooter he’s signed at Kansas, which is saying something considered the history of sweet shooting wings that have played at Kansas during his tenure, many of whom were early draft picks … He has lived up to the hype in many regards, ranking 2nd of the team in scoring with 14.3 ppg, hitting over 40% of his shots from downtown and higher than 85% of his FT attempts…He also has been a quality defensive player and an asset in transition too, using his instincts to come up with a number of steals and deflections and using his jump shot to space the floor and create slashing lanes to pull up or finish when he gets an opening … There are questions about how his limited physical and athletic tools will allow certain parts of his game to translate to the next level, particularly as a finisher and against certain defensive matchups, and about how productive he can be when his shots aren’t falling, but he seems to have the kind of size, shooting and positional defense to help a team as he gain experience … He also seems to be a quick study who has shown plus decision making and basketball IQ for a 19 year old….Players with a standout skill and the smarts he displays generally find a way to stick in the NBA, and he certainly projects to at the very least be a 3-point weapon who can get his shot off in multiple different ways, and if his defense remains steady he will be a good fit as a 3-and-D specialist on the perimeter … He should hear his name called in the 1st round of the draft and possibly the lottery depending on team need …
Notes:
Measured 6′ 6.25” barefoot, 8′ 5.00” standing reach, 204 lbs and a 6′ 8.75” wingspan and a 29 inch standing vertical and a 34′ inch max vertical at the 2023 NBA Draft Combine …

Doesn’t break down the defense or create much space/separation with his dribble. Generally, pulls up off one or two dribbles, takes a straight attack, or picks his dribble up. Struggles in traffic whether it’s keeping his dribble or trying to get off a clean shot at the rim … Can improve scoring efficiency overall. Averaged 10.4 points per game on 40% FG% at the NBPA Top 100 in 2021 and 17.5 points per game on 46.1% FG% over the NIBC in 2021-22 … Solid passer and can make the right play but isn’t an advanced playmaker … Not a great rebounder for size … As someone who doesn’t stand out as a rebounder or playmaker, he can lack offensive contribution if his shot’s not falling …

Evan Tomes 7/19/22  After an outstanding opening-round performance against No. 16 seed Howard (19 points, 11 rebounds, five assists), Dick's impact was far more muted in a disappointing upset loss to No. 8 seed Arkansas, scoring seven points on 3-for-9 shooting.

He showed good activity and smarts crashing the glass and competing defensively, but showed his strength, length and experience limitations on several occasions, especially guarding the smaller Davonte Davis on switches and being unable to keep him off his stronger left hand. Dick has been solid on that end this season but wasn't able to break free for open shots and provide the coveted shot-making ability that makes him such an appealing NBA prospect, being hounded on and off the ball by Arkansas' defense and struggling to attack closeouts effectively.

Dick's freshman season was overwhelmingly positive, as he hit 40% of his 3-pointers and was able to show enough competence in other areas to not project as just a one-dimensional specialist in the NBA. His size, high skill level, feel for the game, competitiveness and youth at 19 years old gives Dick a very high floor in the modern game and there are reasons to believe he'll continue to develop his offensive versatility long-term.-- Jonathan Givony  When thinking about all of the attributes that make an elite shooter, Dick checks all of the boxes. For starters, he’s got a smooth shot and quick release that results in him converting on a high percentage of his triples. Dick is also great at moving without the ball, with a great understanding of how to get himself open for a shot. While he was projected to be a first rounder entering his freshman season, he's not firmly a lottery talent. 
With how good of a shooter the 6-foot-7 forward is, he really opens up the paint for teammates with how much gravity he demands. Defenders must stick to him and not help over on drives unless they want to give up a high percentage shot from deep.
Not only can Dick knock down triples in spot-up situations, but he’s also effective on the move. Whether it’s coming off of a screen for a quick catch-and-shoot or off the bounce, the Kansas prospect can fade either direction away from his defender to create space.
While Dick is perhaps the best shooter in this class, he proved he's a well-rounded scorer as a freshman. At the NBA level, he’ll need to continue to improve at all three levels and not default to being one dimensional on that end of the floor as just a perimeter shooter.
When driving the ball, Dick does lack the explosiveness and creative moves to get by good defenders. He’s more of a straight line driver that leverages his physicality and size to get to the rim. However, he is good at using fakes and jabs to get defenders to over-commit in order to get to his spots.
Additionally, he’ll need to become a better facilitator. He’s a good ball mover within the flow of the offense, but we haven’t necessarily seen him generate many shots for his teammates. This has resulted in low assist numbers, which is an area he could improve at.
Dick is a smart team defender that understands schemes and rotations. He’s good at taking charges and often finds himself in the right spot on the defensive end. He’s not an elite individual defender at the point of attack, but he does have good size and bounce which should be somewhat helpful as he proves himself at the NBA level.
Playing with a ton of energy, Dick is a natural leader and motivator on floor. He truly competes to win games and has the best interest of his team in mind.
Dick led one of the best high school teams in the country as a senior at Sunrise Christian Academy. This led him to winning Gatorade Boys Basketball Player of the Year. Then, went to play for one of the most prestigious college programs in the country and proved he has what it takes to be a really impactful player in the NBA."
Jordan Hawkins,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Isaiah Joe
Strengths:
Hawkins is slender, lengthy 6’5 185 SG prospect with good athletic ability … Possesses a sweet jump shot that is undoubtedly his bread and butter offensively (nearly 38 3FG% on over seven 3FGA per game) and he should only get better … One of the best and most confident shooters in the 2023 Draft class; can get rolling spotting up, in rhythm off the bounce in either direction, as a transition trail man, and impressively coming off screens and pin downs … Very clean and consistent shooting mechanics squaring himself up for shots; shoots a pretty ball with feathery touch and a hairpin trigger release … Moves exceptionally well off the ball and navigates off-ball motion as well as anybody in the college game … Can get hot and hit shots in bunches (16 ppg as a Soph.); as of writing has had 10 games where he made 4 or more 3-point shots as a Soph … Quick with solid footwork to get into the paint when guarded tightly on the perimeter … Will cut and occasionally slash to the rim when played aggressively by defenders who try to force him off the 3-point line, and has the explosive leaping ability off 1 or both feet to finish above the rim … Has some success pulling up from mid-range too … Will be a threat in transition with his athleticism & speed, and is a high flyer when he has a running start … Won’t be confused with a facilitator (1.3 APG this season), but is starting to sporadically use his shooting gravity to find open teammates for easy shots … Active defender who contests shots (17 blocks as a Soph.), works to get himself back into plays when beat off the bounce, and should be able to match up with either guard spot at the NBA level given his length and lateral quickness … Has had some encouraging flashes as an on-ball defender pressuring the ball and occasionally roaming around to get deflections as a help defender as well … Reliable FT shooter (88 FT% on over 3 FTA) which further illustrates his touch …
Weaknesses:
Not an efficient player right now (40 FG% as a Soph., career 39%) and doesn’t get to the rim as much as he should considering his twitchy athleticism and length … Shoots a ton of jump shots and has proven to be more streaky than consistent with it despite solid deep ball numbers … Mediocre ball-handling ability & feel for the game; posted a negative A/TO in both of his seasons at UConn (career 1/1.2) and settles quite a bit as a shot selector … Doesn’t pass the ball that much … Very right-hand dependent player; upside as an overall shot-creator and finisher at the rim amongst the trees will be limited until he improves using his left (45 FG% inside the arc) … Not a particularly physical or tough player and would benefit from adding muscle/getting stronger on both ends of the floor … Some concern that he will get washed out of plays often when working through screens defensively at the pro level … Somewhat foul prone for a guard (2.3 fpg as a Soph.) and will gamble and pick up ticky-tack reaching calls at times … Seemed to become more conservative as a help defender as the season wore along; didn’t force nearly as many turnovers down the stretch as he did at the beginning of the season …
Overall:
Jordan Hawkins was a 4-star recruit out of the powerhouse DeMatha Catholic program in Maryland who flashed nice potential as a Fr. for UConn in limited minutes behind some experienced guards in the 2021-2022 season … He was a popular preseason pick to breakout in the Big East as a Soph. and he did not disappoint, boosting his stats and efficiency across the board, nearly tripling his scoring totals and earning 1st Team all-conference honors … He had plenty of games where he lit up the scoreboard with his shooting stroke and put NBA scouts on notice with his twitchy athletic ability, illustrating good scoring potential and high intensity on the defensive end … He needs to get stronger and develop a better off-hand (both of which tie hand-and-hand with his lack of offensive efficiency) or he may be typecast into instant offense or 3-and-D type roles despite having the natural talent and physical tools of someone capable of more … Still, his ability to shoot in so many different ways without having to dominate the ball, his speed & athleticism to fit well in an up-tempo offense, and his lateral quickness and length defensively give him a higher floor as a SG prospect … He isn’t yet the sum of his parts, but he is fun to watch, has excellent potential and will be given plenty of hard looks by teams searching for a 2-guard that are selecting in the mid-to-late 1st round of the 2023 Draft …
Notes:
Measured 6′ 4.25” barefoot, 8′ 5.50” standing reach, 186 lbs and a 6′ 6.75” wingspan at the 2023 NBA Draft Combine …
Jorrye Nixon 3/23/23  Hawkins took his game to another level in the Sweet 16 and Elite Eight, dropping 44 points on 25 field goal attempts shooting 9-for-19 (47%) for 3.

Gonzaga failed to slow Hawkins down with him running off screens, ducking behind handoffs, making side-step 3-pointers and hitting spot-ups with a quick release and exceptional footwork. He has a coveted skill set he can hang his hat on from Day 1 in the NBA.

In the game against Arkansas, Hawkins showed there's more to his play than ""just"" being a sniper, as he got downhill attacking overplays, sloppy closeouts, handoffs and curls with both his left and right hand, going inside the arc and drawing nine free throw attempts.

He's shooting 44% inside the arc with more turnovers than assists, and although improved, doesn't offer as much resistance defensively with his light frame, limiting his ceiling. Nevertheless, Hawkins is the plug-and-play scorer many playoff teams seek, and the 20-year-old has additional versatility and upside left with more explosiveness than one would guess at first glance.-- Jonathan Givony  A 6-foot-5 guard, Hawkins had the chance to be a breakout sophomore this season and took full advantage of the opportunity, leading his team to a dominant NCAA Tournament run and ultimately a championship. In an increased role, he tripled his scoring output, nearly doubled his assist production and became one of the most notable 3-point shooters in the country. This was especially true in the biggest moments, as he proved to be more than just a catch-and-shoot guy, showcasing the ability to hit advanced perimeter shots on the move. 

He showed flashes of greatness as a freshman, but was somewhat inconsistent due to injuries. He was a highly rated recruit for UConn and has now fully exceeded expectations at the college level. 
A versatile combo guard, Hawkins is a really good athlete. He’s got ideal NBA size and plays smart on both ends.
It will be interesting to see if he ends up being more of a point guard or off-ball guard at the next level. He’s got upside at both positions, so it may depend on the personnel Hawkins is on the floor with.
When he gets to the rim, the rising guard has a ton of pop and gets to the rim quickly. He can throw it down or finish with a ton of skill. Hawkins does favor his right hand, but has improved finishing with his left.

On the defensive end, Hawkins really has tremendous upside. He’s incredible at the point of attack and has great footwork. He’s able to leverage his combination of length and lateral quickness to guard up to three positions. Hawkins is disciplined and works well within a scheme.
Overall, Hawkins should be a really solid two-way guard at the NBA level. The defensive upside is certainly real, which he showed during many points throughout the season.
As a senior at DeMatha Catholic, Hawkins led the team to undefeated record while winning 2020-21 Gatorade Maryland Player of the Year. One of the most improved college players year-over-year, Hawkins is now a solidified first-round pick."
Kobe Bufkin,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Jordan Poole
Strengths:
Bufkin is a lean 6’4 190 southpaw SG prospect who has smooth athletic ability and quickness as well as the frame to add mass without losing athleticism … Currently enjoying a bit of a breakthrough year as a Soph. after playing very limited minutes in his frosh season; has shown promise in his scoring from all over the court (nearly 14 ppg on 48 FG%) and significant improvement in his jump shooting (22 3FG% in ‘21-22, compared to around 35% on 3.6 3FGA this season) particularly down the stretch of Michigan’s Big 10 conference slate … Plays at his own pace, has some craftiness to his game and creates driving lanes for himself well … Rangy, downhill slasher who makes good use of ball-fakes in the lane and knows how to get defenders to lunge and take the bait to get space for his shots … Has good touch to convert around the rim and in the short corners with his floater (56 FG% inside the arc this season)…Shows signs of being able to hit 3-point shots off the dribble, using hand-offs and when running to open spots along the perimeter, and has started to prove capable of hitting enough shots from NBA range to keep defenders honest when they dive screens … Also has been solid off 1-2 bounce pull-ups from mid-range when chased off the line…Pretty solid handle and burst, with nice potential creating in the pick and roll game…Unselfish player who may get a long look at minutes as a lead guard in the future from some coaches after showing some decent ability as a passer this year (2.8 apg) despite only sporadically getting a chance to initiate the offense … Competes hard on defense and has held up well when asked to deny dribble penetration when isolated or fighting through screens … Has quick hands and times when to jump in passing lanes to get deflections well, while also making effort to contest shots near him on the perimeter (1.3 spg & 21 blocks in regular season play) … Should be able to defend either guard spot at the NBA level depending on the matchup … Is able to contribute in a variety of ways on both ends of the court … Decent rebounding skills for a guard (4.3 rpg) … Has been pretty good from the charity stripe when he gets there (nearly 84 FT% this season, career 82%) … A smart player whose accelerated development in one season points to a hard worker that has the potential to keep growing and is seemingly a safe bet to polish his areas of improvement … Young for a 2nd year player; would just be turning 20 at the start of training camp as a rookie this year … Listed at 6’4, but could be 6’5 in shoes and appears to have a 6’8 to 6’9 wingspan …
Weaknesses:
Though he’s improved as a shooter he still is somewhat inconsistent with it the further out his shoots … Will have to prove his long range shooting improvement is sustainable … Could do a better job with his shot selection at times; has possessions when he dribbles the ball too much or forces unnecessary contested jumpers … Not a particularly dynamic athlete or impressive physical presence and may find it more difficult to convert at the rim consistently against NBA frontcourt players like he has at Michigan this season, despite his length and savvy ability creating angles to finish … Sometimes overzealous defensively with his gambles for steals and gets himself out of position … Tendency to reach when looking to create turnovers also comes with unnecessarily foul totals, especially for a guard (2.4 fpg, fouled out of 4 games as a Soph.) … Has moments when his inexperience shows on both ends of the court, and isn’t quite the sum of his parts as a prospect yet …
Overall:
Bufkin came to Michigan as an in-state player who top 50 recruit in the 2021 HS class, but had to wait his turn behind a group of upperclassmen and highly touted Caleb Houston (averaged 3 ppg and 10 mpg) … This season he took advantage of the extended minutes available from the losses in the backcourt; more than quadrupling his scoring output, seeing upward trajectory in efficiency and overall production across the board, and going from a 2023 Draft afterthought to an intriguing 2-way prospect that has played his way into 1st round discussion as the season has progressed…He has combo guard potential, the makings of a nice 3 level scoring skill set, solid defensive effort and shows the type of basketball IQ that suggests he will continue to grow as a player as he earns more trust from whatever coaching staff he goes to … The end of Michigan’s season, as they currently fight for an at-large NCAA tourney bid during championship week, and his performance in pre-draft workouts will speak volumes about whether he gets a first round grade for the 2023 NBA Draft class that would be hard to pass up or if he decides to come back for his Jr. season … He may not come into the league ready to play from Day 1, as he has some polish to add to his game, mass to add to his frame, and consistency to add to his jumper, but he is definitely someone teams will keep a close eye on as a developmental prospect over the coming months and beyond …
Notes:
Measured 6′ 4.25” barefoot, 8′ 6.50” standing reach, 186.8 lbs and a 6′ 7.75” wingspan and a 29 inch standing vertical and a 36′ inch max vertical at the 2023 NBA Draft Combine …
Jorrye Nixon 3/15/23  Bufkin has taken his game to another level over the past 10 games, ramping up his aggressiveness significantly, improving his perimeter shooting (45% 3P%) and emerging as one of the most disruptive defenders in the Big Ten.

With his outstanding open-court speed and increasing comfort as a ball handler, decision-maker and pull-up shooter in the half court -- and because he's the same age or younger than many freshmen projected to be one-and-done -- there's a lot to like about Bufkin's long-term outlook.

For Michigan to prolong its season, it'll need Bufkin to continue to attack defenses as relentlessly as he has over the past two-plus months. Regardless of how the season ends, teams are certain to be interested in what Bufkin elects to do this spring despite his thin frame and still-developing playmaking ability. -- Jonathan Givony  Entering the recent college season, Bufkin was viewed by most as a potential breakout candidate, but also had a high likelihood of being overshadowed by other NBA Draft prospects at Michigan.
After coming off the bench in every game as a freshman, Bufkin was a permanent starter in year two. He emerged as a primary scoring option with good positional size at 6-foot-4. An efficient shooter, the Wolverine showcased the ability to score at all three levels.
Despite being a two year college athlete, Bufkin will still be 19 on the night of the 2023 NBA Draft. He’s on the younger side of his class and will be viewed as a player that still has a tremendous amount of untapped potential. While he didn’t get the chance to perform in the NCAA Tournament on the big stage as the team didn't make the cut, the Michigan native had plenty of stellar moments in the regular season.
When watching Bufkin play, it’s easy to see why he has gained draft buzz. He’s a confident guard that demands attention and immediately passes the eye test. He’s a great athlete with a smooth lefty stroke, which is fun to watch. Whether it’s knocking down a deep triple or finishing with authority at the rim, Bufkin can do it all. Despite being a southpaw, he’s comfortable finishing with either hand.
At the NBA level, it will be interesting to see how much he plays on the ball. While Bufkin has the skillset to be a lead guard, he’s also excellent as an off-ball scoring threat. The 3-point shot didn’t fall much for him as a freshman, but he really increased his efficiency this season. Moving forward, that will need to continue to improve. The mechanics of his jumper, the range he’s already shown and the free throw efficiency should give NBA teams confidence he’ll be a good perimeter shooter at the next level.
Being a self creator is a necessary skill for a scoring prospect that’s looking to make it at the next level. With the ball in his hands, Bufkin is crafty and can generate his own shots. While he can knock down more advanced, higher difficulty shots, sometimes the shot selection is poor for the 19-year-old. Regardless, the flashes we've seen are impressive, especially in the midrange.
While he’s not the biggest or strongest guard, Bufkin plays with a ton of energy and effort. He’s a great positional rebounder and a pesky defender. He averaged two stocks per game as a sophomore and really improved on that end in year two. He’s got a long way to go defensively, especially as it relates to taking too many gambles and not fouling, but he’s trending in the right direction.

Bufkin has declared for the upcoming draft, but will still have the chance to come back to school for another season an exponentially increase his draft stock. While there’s a great chance he will be taken in the first round this summer, there’s an even better shot in the 2024 NBA Draft if he were to have another big season as a junior.
Whether it’s now or in a year, the former four-star recruit will be wearing an NBA uniform."
Keyonte George,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Cam Thomas/Markelle Fultz
Strengths:
George is a 6’4 185 SG prospect with adequate strength and a frame that has slimmed down since his HS days, being more toned but also able to add on muscle if necessary … Intrigues with his raw shot-making ability (15.3 PPG as a Fr.); had some impressive moments filling it up from all over the court that some teams will want to harness … Aggressive and is at his best attacking downhill when his match ups are on their heels … Can score in bunches at his best and likes to create his own offense, whether its using ball screens or by getting to his spots in isolation … Good handle and is tricky to contain in space due to his knack for changing his rhythm when attacking off the dribble … Flashes unpredictability with the angles and platforms that he will rise into shots from; utilizes drifting fadeaway jumpers and will slither/sidestep into tight spaces in the lane for floaters and lay-ups … Able to finish with either hand…Promising pull-up jumper, especially going to his right; had success in the mid-range but also hit enough long-range shots off the bounce to keep the defense honest…Fluid, compact shooting stroke with a high and tight release … Seems to be a better shooter than his numbers indicated as a Fr … Enough body control and footwork to become a factor as a shooter coming off screens … Willing to take tough shots, and can convert due to his touch and confidence … Not afraid of contact and drew fouls at a pretty good rate as a Fr. (79 FT% on 4.5 FTA/G) … Was willing to chip in on the glass from the perimeter as a Fr. (4.2 RPG) … Had to play off the ball more often than he’s accustomed to this past season, which in a way may have helped accelerate his development in rounding out his offensive game … Some flashes of pick and roll playmaking; will likely be given chances to develop into a secondary playmaker at the next level (2.8 APG) … Has instant offense/microwave scorer type traits …
Weaknesses:
Mediocre physical and athletic profile for an NBA guard prospect … Not really an above the rim finisher, relies heavily on skill and creativity to pressure the rim and finish in the paint … Can be a bit of a chucker currently (33.8 3FG% on about 7 3FGA/G); would probably see a spike in his efficiency by being more judicious with his shot selection (37.6 FG%) … Makes just enough lower percentage, contested shots to encourage himself to keep taking them and those shots will be more difficult to see success with at the pro level … More streaky than a truly reliable knockdown shooter right now despite his tools…Posted a negative A:TO (2.8:2.9), which is not ideal for a player considered to be combo guard and speaks to a lack of natural playmaking skills for others…Tends to be pretty deliberate with where he wants to go with the ball on his feeds and should work on not telegraphing his passes … Will at times over-dribble and try to create plays that aren’t there … Doesn’t handle being blitzed in pick and roll coverage very well right now; struggles to turn the corner off the dribble due to his middling speed and can get smothered or forced into wasted possessions … Feel for the game and basketball IQ are both a work in progress … Fair to question what type of impact he can have on games at the next level if his shots aren’t falling  …  Can have lapses on defense and should work on his fundamentals as an on-ball defender; particularly with consistently sinking his hips and moving his feet with a purpose … The idea of what he can become is greater than the sum of his parts right now; still pretty green and in need of polish & experience … Weight and conditioning will be something he has to stay focused on, as he has a history of weight gain …
Overall:
Keyonte George is a highly prospect originally from Texas where he spent the majority of his time in HS, before transferring to powerhouse IMG Academy in Florida and solidifying himself as a top 10 recruit in the 2022 Class … He would later commit to Baylor and had a productive season in the Big12, finishing 2nd on the team in scoring and assists for a Bears team that made it to the Round of 32 in ‘22-23 … He had to get in where he could fit in on a team that had 2 experienced guards who have proven to be productive in their own right in Adam Flagler and LJ Cryer, perhaps not being a seamless fit due to overlapping play styles, and George often didn’t have the ball in his hands as much as he probably would’ve wanted, partly resulting in a pretty inconsistent one-and-done season … Still, he showed enough talent and potential that there is optimism about his NBA future, and his experience off the ball, though maybe not ideal for him, may actually aid his transition to the NBA because he surely will have to share ball-handling duties at the pro level as well given his middling playmaking profile … He needs to shore up his shot selection and on-court decision making in general, as his overall efficiency wasn’t particularly encouraging as a Fr, but his shot creation ability and pedigree will pique the interest of teams picking late lottery and in the 2nd half of 1st round hoping to reign in George’s skills and potential fit within their team’s system …
Jorrye Nixon 5/25/23
Strengths:
6’4 combo guard … Strong build and body frame. Finishes well through contact … Good athlete. Jumps well off one or both feet with good body control … Good scorer in the half-court and has a knack for hitting difficult shots. Gets shots off with little space from the defender. Finished 2

Shot a solid 77.1% FT% over the NIBC in 2021-22 … Quick with the ball and stays under control when picking up speed. Changes direction well and gets into the paint. Good instincts and reactive to the defense with the ball. Drives well going to both his left and right. Good finisher at the rim … Can play on or off the ball … Solid passer, can make some impressive lead passes and thread the needle at times. Reads double-teams and avoids traps well … Stays engaged defensively. Defends well on the ball and has active hands …
Weaknesses:
Has room to tighten up and improve his body, has shown in his (lack of) athleticism and explosion/quickness closing out his high school career … Still has room to improve 3PT consistency as he’s more on the streaky side. Doesn’t consistently make his open knock-down opportunities but the foundation is there … Solid passer and ball-handler but has a way to go if he’s going to run the point, even as a combo, at the next levels. Only averaged 1.2 assists per game over the NIBC in 2021-22. Tends to have more turnovers than assists …

Evan Tomes 7/20/22  George didn't have a great NCAA tournament weekend, shooting a combined 3-for-19 from the field and bowing out in the round of 32 with a loss to Creighton on Sunday. His effectiveness and efficiency really ebbed and flowed over the last two months and his questionable shot selection and defensive lapses caused him to spend more time on the bench than you would expect this last weekend.

George wasn't a great fit on either end of the floor with Baylor's undersize scoring guards -- Adam Flagler and LJ Cryer -- as each of them need the ball to be effective, live off a steady diet of difficult shots and lack length in a backcourt that struggled to get stops all season. George made some progress defensively this season and even had some moments against the Bluejays by stepping in for a charge and forcing opponents into tough pull-ups. But his inability to navigate screens, propensity for flying on every fake and lapses off the ball made it tough for George as he failed to get stops for Baylor in an up-tempo game featuring impressive shot-making from Creighton's guards.

George's scoring instincts and ability to hit pull-up jumpers and make pocket passes out of pick and roll give him a high floor as a strongly built 6-4 combo guard. He didn't do enough late in the season to solidify himself in mid-lottery conversations but still has an obvious niche he can fill as a bucket-getter with upside to grow into.-- Jonathan Givony  George was one of the best combo guards in this freshman class and is a microwave scorer. Standing at 6-foot-4, he isn’t as tall as some guards in the modern NBA but he has the physical frame to make up for it. He’s strong for his age and has a broad build which should help him on both ends of the floor at the next level.
As explosive of an athlete as the Baylor freshman is vertically, he’s not all that quick with the ball in his hands. He doesn’t have an elite first step or the speed to blow by defenders, but George uses his strength to bully defenders.
He’s also got a variety of moves in his offense game that he’s not afraid to use on that end of the floor. Whether it’s dribble moves, jabs or pump fakes, George is crafty with the ball in his hands and still finds ways to get himself open in a more methodical manner. An advanced shot creator, he will definitely be capable of scoring at a high level early in his NBA career.
When the 6-foot-4 guard finds his way to the paint he’s an explosive jumper that has no problem finishing at the rack and playing above the rim. He’s a strong downhill slasher and attacker.
When it comes down to it, George is simply one of the best in this draft class at getting a bucket. He’s proven at the high school level that he’s willing and able to take and make big buckets, especially down the stretch of close games. This continued into his sole college campaign, being the alpha on a loaded Baylor roster. The Texas native isn’t afraid to pull the trigger, as he’s a confident shooter for good reason. While his 3-point shooting efficiency wasn't great as a freshman, there's plenty of evidence that would suggest he will be a productive perimeter scorer in the NBA.
Overall on the offensive end of the floor, George is more skill than athleticism as it relates to generating his shots. He could potentially be a unique guard that can work some from the post situationally using his strength against smaller college players. Regardless, he's a gifted scorer at all three levels.
Where George gets taken in the 2023 NBA Draft will likely come down to what type of passer and facilitator teams think he can be moving forward. As a freshman this season, he produced more turnovers than assists.
How will he be able to impact the game outside of being a volume scorer? If there’s a night in which his shot isn’t falling, George needs to do other things at a high level that impact winning.
If he if he can’t improve as a pure point guard and passer, he’ll likely begin to see himself in an off-ball guard role. That’s not necessarily a bad thing as he’s already proven to be effective in that role to this point, but George’s stock will rise a ton if he’s able to showcase the ability to make those around him better in the pre-draft process. 
George has the frame to become a good defender, but that end of the floor certainly isn’t what he’s known for as of now. That’s another swing skill to we kept an eye on this season at Baylor, and he did show some positive flashes overall
Spending his senior season at IMG Academy, George played with two other potential lottery picks in Jarace Walker (Houston)and Jett Howard (Michigan), who he will be directly competing with for draft positioning this summer.
Outside of playing high school ball and AAU, George represented the United States in a 3-on-3 setting at the 2021 FIBA 3x3 Under-18 World Cup, where he showcased his scoring ability and won tournament MVP on the way to a gold medal. He also was the recipient of the MVP Award at the 2022 Iverson Classic, rising above some of the other top prospects in his graduating class."

Hood-Schifino is a strong-bodied combo guard who stands 6’6 215 with good length (6’10 wingspan) … Mature build; is tailor-made for physical play on both ends of the court … Fits well in slower paced, half-court offense; is most comfortable handling the ball, being calculating and taking his time to find his favorite spots on the floor to score or find open teammates … High skill level and creativity with the ability to make ambidextrous passes and finishes near the rim and in the intermediate areas … Manipulates the defense with his eyes and whizzes passes to open players on the move … Excellent in the pick and roll and dribble handoff game; formed a prolific duo with Trayce Jackson-Davis in ‘22-23  … Unselfish and has solid floor vision, with a good feel for making passing lanes by tilting the defense one way creating openings for shooters or dump-offs to his bigs (3.7 APG) … Among the best mid-range pull-up scorers in college hoops this past season, and really hurts defenses the most with the ball in the 15-18 ft area (13.5 PPG) … A downhill slasher who uses his size/strength advantages at the point of attack to get smaller guards on his hip, but also has the hesitation dribbles to freeze help defenders and get good looks for himself and teammates … Very even-keeled; plays at his own pace and rarely ever seems rushed … Adequate handle and burst to exploit mismatches when bigs switch onto him … Competitive player who will take on tough defensive matchups and has the ability to ‘guard up’ on the perimeter, doesn’t just defend his position … Very good defensive potential on the perimeter and has the strength and toughness to develop into a major factor at the point of attack and fighting through screens … Uses his physical tools and solid footwork to wall off penetration well…Chips in on the glass (4.1 RPG) … Decent from the FT line when he gets there (77.6 FT%)  …
Weaknesses:
Lacks athleticism by NBA standards … Below the rim player that is more subtle than sudden … Not particularly quick or speedy … Doesn’t have great projections as a transition player … Only sporadically gets all the way to the rim against set defense … Low efficiency as a finisher speaks to his struggles when looking to convert amongst the trees (45 FG% inside the arc) … His patience with the ball can straddle with being too deliberate at times, making it easier for the defense to anticipate what he wants to do next as a passer and slasher (2.8 TOPG, 1.3:1 A:TO) … Not necessarily a natural PG; played enhanced minutes there due to injury and is still developing some decision-making & ball-handling nuance, particularly against athletic help defense that can crowd him and wont dive underneath screens often … 3-point shooting is a work in progress (33 3FG% as a Fr.), though he did show flashes as the season went along off the dribble and has the touch to continue to get better … Would greatly benefit as an off-ball player from at least being able to adequately hit spot-up shots from distance; his offensive profile would be really nicely rounded out with the threat of a deep ball … Doesn’t draw contact as much as he should given his size (only 2.4 FTA/G), can fall in love with the mid-range too much and bail out defenders at times … Has quick hands but didn’t force many turnovers in college (0.8 SPG), and is better defending on the ball than off at the moment …
Overall:
Jalen Hood-Schifino is a prospect who established himself as a consensus 5-star recruit during his Jr and Sr seasons at national powerhouse Montverde Academy, where he won 2 HS national titles and played in the Jordan Brand Classic … He joined Indiana as their highest rated signee since 2018 and was largely seen as the preseason favorite to be the Big 10 Freshman of the Year (which he did win at the end of the season) and largely lived up to the hype, helping lead Indiana to a Round of 32 finish…He started the season sharing ball-handling responsibilities but became the teams main ball-handler after an injury to their upperclassman starting PG Xavier Johnson, ultimately forming a blossoming connection and dynamic duo with All-American and fellow 2023 Draft prospect Trayce Jackson-Davis that was among the strongest 1-2 punches in the NCAA this past season…He also had some big moments this season, particularly his memorable 35-point, 6 3-pointer outburst in a win @ then-1st ranked Purdue in late February … Hood-Schifino’s pick and roll prowess with Jackson-Davis offered nice glimpses of his potential NBA role as a strong-bodied 6’6 slasher who used the threat of his big to torch teams in the mid-range area with his picture-esque pull-up J and instinctive passing ability on the move … He also was well-equipped to handle defensive responsibilities in the physical Big 10 as a Fr. and had some outstanding moments as an on-ball defender that project well to the pros … His lack athleticism does to a degree lower his upside, and he will need to continue to improve his shooting range, particularly with his feet set, to round out his offensive game and realize his potential versatility to play multiples spots along the perimeter offensively and not always have to operate with the ball in his hands, even though that’s when he’s clearly at his best … Still, Hood-Schifino’s game is really promising, as is his competitive nature, and he has a ton of traits & skills that translate well to NBA basketball today as a PG/SG … Look for him to be selected in the 1st round of the 2023 Draft, with a pretty good chance to be snagged in the lottery …

Jorrye Nixon 5/24/23  Hood-Schifino showed what intrigues NBA scouts with his terrific size, live-dribble passing and shot-making, but had a poor showing overall on Sunday. In what's likely his last game for Indiana, Hood-Schifino was 8-for-22 from the field with three assists and three turnovers in a blowout loss to Miami. Hood-Schifino started off the game ice-cold from the perimeter, got beat repeatedly off the dribble and had sloppy turnovers, forcing the Hoosiers to play catch-up. He hit three difficult pull-up 3s at one key juncture to try and keep Indiana in the game, but couldn't get enough stops due to some off-ball lapses and turnovers at key moments.  This was still a successful season for Hood-Schifino, who stepped into a key role as Indiana's lone ball-handler outside of center Trayce Jackson-Davis due to starting point guard Xavier Johnson's broken foot, giving him plenty of freedom and confidence to show off his significant talent as a passer and off the dribble shooter. NBA teams are still getting a handle on how quickly the home run hitter will be able to contribute to winning in a more compact role and how long it might take to get him to play with better consistency, but there's little doubt that Hood-Schifino's upside is one of the highest of any guard in this year's draft.-- Jonathan Givony
  A legitimate two-way talent, Hood-Schifino is a prospect that was pinned as someone who could rise up draft boards throughout his freshman season at Indiana, which is exactly what happened. He’s one of the more patient guards in this class, which results in highly impactful offensive contributions and great decision making.
Hood-Schifino was the highest rated incoming freshman in the Big Ten, meaning expectations were high. He can play either guard spot or on the wing but has pure point guard instinct. A real playmaker, he makes his teammates better and understands winning basketball.
With these high expectations, Hood-Schifino had the opportunity to play a key role on an experienced Indiana team. He plays with high energy and emerged as a player that brings those around him to a new level.
As a scorer, Hood-Schifino has proven to be highly effective from two levels, but is working on the third. At times during his freshman season, he looked like a guy that could be a consistent 40% shooter from deep, but had many up and down stretches from that range throughout the year. Shooting was the swing skill for Hood-Schifino entering the season, and it's still somewhat unclear what his upside looks like in that respect. 
The Indiana prospect's effectiveness in the midrange leads you to think he’ll ultimately be fine from beyond the arc down the road. The mechanics of his triple are different than that of his midrange jumper, so he needs to find some consistency as he gets further from the rim.
On the topic of midrange, this is where Hood-Schifino really showcases his patience. Most young players feel rushed in that range and often force shots or make the wrong read. Hood-Schifino is different, as he uses various paces and lets the right move come to him. Whether it’s allowing things to happen around him to find an open teammate or shooting it himself, he’s a great decision maker. He’s got a reliable jumper from this range and also is effective with a smooth, tight floater.
He’s also great off the bounce and really thrives as a play finisher at the rim. The 6-foot-5 guard draws a ton of attention in doing so and is a willing passer out to teammates when defenses collapse.
Overall as a scorer, Hood-Schifino is more smooth than he is explosive. He’s got incredible change of speed and plays with great pace when attacking. Once he gets into the paint, he’s got good body control and doesn’t shy away from contact. He also has no problem finishing with either hand at a high level.
A legitimate lead guard, Hood-Schifino generally makes the right plays although his turnovers were fairly high. He’s able to impact the game even without scoring.
Defensively, he is great at the point of attack and boasts awesome footwork and lateral speed. He has the size and tools to defend upwards of three positions at a high level. He’s got a unique toughness and a knack for the ball on that end and loves to pick his opponent’s pocket. Simply put, he just gets it on that end. Hood-Schifino’s defensive is a huge driver of winning and his IQ is extremely high as a natural defender.
He’s the type of player you trust in the game during crunch time as he truly impacts winning. Hood-Schifino’s patience really sticks out as he analyzes each situation and let’s the right play come to him.
If he can prove the perimeter shot is real during workouts in the pre-draft process, the former five-star recruit could go in the middle part of the first round this summer. 
Before coming to Indiana, Hood-Schifino played against the top competition in the country at Montverde Academy, where he played alongside Dariq Whitehead (Duke), Dillon Mitchell (Texas) and Skyy Clark (Louisville transfer) among others. Hood-Schifino led the team to back-to back national championships before his career came to an end.
This season at Indiana, it was fantastic to see him run a two-man game with Trayce Jackson-Davis. The Big Ten is a premier conference where play is extremely physical, which proved to be no problem for Hood-Schifino. As the season went on, he continued to rise up boards and could up being an underrated jumbo guard selection."
Jaime Jaquez,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Jorge Garbajosa
Strengths:
Extremely high intangibles guy that impacts games in ways that don’t always show on the boxscore … Unique skillset with his high IQ and feel for the game … Very soft stroke from midrange and loves the little fadeaways … High energy, always pushing the pace, especially on offense … Can be a hair slow-footed on defense, but makes up for it with smarts, his solid 6-9.5 wingspan, and good instincts … Was part of a UCLA squad that really excelled on defense … Has a strong body, and can really bump down low … seeks out contact on his way to the hoop… defending him looks exhausting… Has crafty finishing ability … In college he took a lot of post up opportunities … Highly versatile on offense — he has a more mature post game than you typically see these days of players of that size … Really brings it and competes hard … Appeared routinely stronger than defenders in college … Fairly quick release out to 3P range with good looking form, but he did not make many threes in college … Can make something out of nothing (chaos) … Utilizes bully ball to his advantage. Loves physical drives where he gets a half step past his defender, gets the shoulder into him, and holds position. From there he will often go into a spin move and silky smooth righty finish at the hoop … Determination. An engaged and aggressive defender with a fantastic motor … Dribbles very powerfully, really slams the ball on the ground making it difficult to steal, with control … He’s incredibly strong, especially when guarded by a two or three, and he really loves that little base line or mid range jumper … He tends to look a little out of control on the drive, especially in the full court. But the result is pure, he usually gets to his spot and can finish with a nice righty scoop lay up or jump stop into a floater … Especially if he can squeeze an extra few inches out of his shooting range and become proficient at least from the corner threes, it will likely make a big difference for his effectiveness at the next level … Insofar as you trust the stat in this context, his defensive rating remained around 89, which is very good. His UCLA teammate, and National Defensive Player of the Year Jaylen Clark had a defensive rating of 86 (which is elite). The question becomes to what extent did Jaquez benefit from playing with another elite defender, and within a great system, vs what his individual contribution and abilities are? All that said, he appears to have many skills, such as good hands and good instincts, that can help on the defensive end. His teammate Clark got a mind blowing 3.4 steals per game. But Jaquez was no slouch – second on the team with a still damn-good 1.9, a testament to his hands and instincts … Decent free throw percentage at just below 80%… it’s surprising he didn’t get there more often given his very physical style of play (less than 4 FTA per game) … Really turned into an elite rebounder his senior year at more than 8 per game total, and 2.5 offensive rebounds per game, a marked improvement over previous seasons …
Weaknesses:
Fast enough in a straight line. But he doesn’t have elite burst (from a standing position) … Measured an amazing 39 inch max vertical at the NBA Draft combine, but honestly did not play that athletic at UCLA … This lack of explosion was apparent on the defensive end, where he may be prone to getting beat by a quick first step. Relies on his strength and physicality … By all accounts is a smart team defender. But lateral quickness is a concern. There were a number of times we saw him get beat in an isolation situation off the dribble by a quicker ballhandler … There are many ways to mask and hide this in the NBA, but of course worth noting … At UCLA he had an anomalous nearly 40% 3P sophomore shooting season. But mostly he was only about 31% from three in his time at UCLA — not good enough for the next level… You’d love to see him rely a little less on the faraway, which can be a hard to shot to maintain consistency with, and instead establish position and go up with a simpler form … If he can maintain consistency in the fadeaway, then by all means, through … 8.3.5″ standing reach is on the small side for a combo forward … Turned 22 in February (16th) making him one of the older players, though what you would expect as a senior …
Overall:
A throwback. Strong, physical forward with a face up game. Has a reputation for being a bit slow-footed especially defensively, which is fair. And he rarely get more than 3-4″ off the floor. But there is a whole lot to like, even defensively, including his excellent hands and instincts and his 6’9.5″ wingspan in 6’7” frame… Can an NBA defensive scheme cover up his slower feet? Yes, and he’s capable of making it worth their while on the offensive end… Anyone who plays in the school yard knows “the old man’s game” and Jaquez has a lot of that. Smarts, craftiness, good hands, physicality, soft touch, and a very powerful spin move / drop step. Would love to see him bump up his 3P percentage, as she’s shown flashes of being capable of. Stylistically, he stands out in a few ways. Stylistically, the way he runs, it’s sort of like these short, choppy steps (but he has decent speed in a straight line). And as mentioned, he jumps more than a few inches inches off the ground … Has experience competing with the best of the best already, holding his own in Rico Hines summer runs with players such as Tyrese Haliburton and Trae Young, among others …
Notes:
Measured 6′ 6.00” barefoot, 8′ 3.50” standing reach, 226.4 lbs, and 6′ 9.50” wingspan, and a 39 inch max vertical at the 2023 NBA Draft Combine … Jaquez was a four year letter winner at UCLA and leaves with a host of accolades and impressive feats:… 8th on UCLA’s All Time career scoring list (1,802)… 8th in career steals (178) and 11th in career rebounding (842), 9th in steals per game (1.33) … 8th in career NCAA Tournament minutes played (450 over 12 games) … Led UCLA in total rebounds in three consecutive seasons (2021, 2022 and 2023) … Named the Lute Olson National Player of the Year (by CollegeInsider.com) … 2023 Pac-12 Player of the Year (UCLA’s first such selection since Kevin Love in 2008) … Two-time Pac-12 All-Defensive Team … Played all minutes numerous time for UCLA (a testament to his motor)! … In high school, was a two-year varsity baseball letter winner as a right-handed pitcher and first baseman … Competes for the Mexican National Team … Both parents played basketball at Concordia University (Irvine)  …
Drew Wolin 6/11/23  Jaquez took care of business in leading UCLA to a third consecutive Sweet 16, doing all the little things that make him a winning player.

He made a pair of 3-pointers, moved the ball intelligently, went to work creating his own shot in the high, mid or low post, and made big plays defensively -- all things we've become accustomed to seeing in his four years with the Bruins.

Nothing he does is particularly aesthetically pleasing or looks certain to seamlessly translate to what his role will be in the NBA, but it's difficult not to appreciate the tremendous feel for the game, competitiveness and versatility Jaquez offers.-- Jonathan Givony  A unique prospect, Jaquez provides versatility as a hybrid between a guard and a wing. He’s highly skilled with good size and a solid frame.
While Jaquez isn’t an elite shooter, he is a very good overall scorer. He plays with physicality and a good feel for the game. The UCLA prospect has underrated speed, but isn’t someone that relies on athleticism to be effective. However, he does like to use his size as an advantage against smaller defenders in the mid-post and in the paint.
On the defensive end, Jaquez is both disruptive and versatile. He does struggle with quicker guards, but can slide up and defend bigger frontcourt players well for his position. He’s also a good positional rebounder and his advanced metrics point directly to a high impact on winning.
At 6-foot-7, his ability to handle the ball has helped him develop into a well-rounded offensive player. With each passing season, his role increased and so did his scoring output.
On the flip side, Jaquez is an older prospect that hasn’t shown the ability to knock down triples at an elite rate. He shot almost 40% as a sophomore, but less than 32% in every other college season. If he’s really going to reach his ceiling at the NBA level and earn minutes early on, that will be a big area of growth needed. Furthermore, he’s not a facilitator or high upside passer, as he doesn’t generate a high number of assists. Jaquez can also be turnover prone at times.
It will be interesting to see his role and position at the next level. He definitely could be more wing-oriented with how athletic and explosive NBA guards are. This is yet another reason his 3-point shot needs to come around. While he is an older prospect, that also comes with experience as he’s played over 200 college games, starting nearly all of them.

A former top 100 recruit in high school, Jaquez also has experience playing for the Mexican National Team at the Pan American Games in 2019. Both of his parents played college basketball, so hoops is in his genes.
The pre-draft process will be key in determining whether Jaquez truly has late first-round upside or if he will go in the second."
Brandin Podziemski,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Matthew Dellavedova
Strengths:
Combo guard with pure shooting stroke and some intangibles to help make up for lack of ideal physical attributes … Head strong combo guard with excellent shooting ability and polished skills … Very good spot up shooter with great range and touch … Lefty has an excellent shooting stroke and has developed into a knock down outside shooter … Considered more of a shooting guard by most scouts, however he has the vision and passing skills to play the point, his speed may make it difficult to be more than a rotational lead guard … Creative passer … Great vision and anticipation … Sees the floor well and can zip half long passes on a dime effortlessly, setting up teammates for easy buckets … Has the handle and passing of a lead guard, just missing the quickness … Mature, intelligent kid who shined after transferring into the big fish in small pond dynamic at Santa Clara … 8.8 rebounds is a huge number of a guard, showing his willingness to play physical and ability to track down rebounds … A near 44% three point shooter (2.5 makes per game) as a sophomore, illustrating his elite shooting ability … Excellent ball handler. Crafty with use of cross overs and behind the back dribbles, and utilizes a step back to create space on pulls ups well … Utilizes the float game well … has a patented Euro step to extend drives … Crafty at using pump fakes and hesitation moves to get defenders off balance … Good at driving and dishing … Knows how to back down smaller opponents and use back to the basket post moves to score … Has solid upside if he lands in the right situation and his speed deficiencies are overcome/masked … Fun to watch, excellent feel for the game …
Weaknesses:
Not the fastest or most athletic guard, and does not have the “look” of an NBA athlete ..Lacks a great first step so defenders can overplay him and jam his shot openings …  Measured a surprising 39 inch max vertical, however he doesn’t necessarily play overly athletic … Struggled at Illinois to crack the rotation as a freshman before transferring to Santa Clara where he had a breakout sophomore season … Detractors will point to the inability to play in a big conference and question whether competition level is a factor … Lack of speed tougher to overcome at the guard positions … his shot is pure, but takes a little while to get off which may make a difference efficiency wise with NBA athletes closing out on him … Not overly strong or physical to help make up for speed shortcomings … Despite being 6’3.75″ barefoot, he lacks length with just a 6′ 5.5” wingspan and only a 8′ 0.5” standing reach, far below standard for an NBA shooting guard … Some questions regarding whether he can be a complimentary player and be a star in his role of a back up at next level … Getting open looks could be a challenge against quicker NBA defenders … Despite being a pure shooter, shot below 80% from the FT line over his two college seasons … Some positional question marks as it’s unclear how well he can operate off the ball and how much value he brings if he’s not able to be a primary ball handler l …
Notes:
Measured 6′ 3.75” barefoot, 8′ 0.5” standing reach, 203.8 lbs and a 6′ 5.5” wingspan and a 31.5 inch standing vertical and a 39′ inch max vertical at the 2023 NBA Draft Combine …
Aran Smith 6/15/23  It's hard to find a more productive player in college basketball over the past 10 games. Podziemski is averaging an outstanding 23.8 points, 10.2 rebounds, 4.1 assists and 1.5 steals while shooting 57% for 2 and 48% for 3 over that stretch, helping him win co-WCC player of the year honors. Unfortunately for him, and NBA scouts, Podziemski's NCAA tournament hopes were dashed when Santa Clara lost in double overtime in the WCC tournament quarterfinals, leaving the Broncos hoping for an NIT invite on Sunday.

Podziemski is shooting 45% for 3 on the season, but is much more than that, seeing a significant amount of offense handling in pick and roll, in isolation, pushing in transition, or coming off screens. He is smart when operating off hesitation moves, splitting or rejecting ball screens, and passing on the move, but has seen his production drop off fairly dramatically against better competition this season, shooting just 43% inside the arc with nearly as many turnovers as assists against top-100 caliber competition. NBA teams have some concerns about Podziemski's physical tools, as he doesn't boast great size, length or frame and has had some tough moments defensively one-on-one against better competition. With that said, he clearly brings an intriguing combination of toughness and smarts which allowed him to lead the WCC in rebounding and post a strong 1.8 steals per game. -- Jonathan Givony  An Illinois transfer, Podziemski played less than 70 minutes all year as a freshman. This season at Santa Clara, he exploded in an expanded role.
After transferring, he became the top scoring option for the Broncos, filling in the shoes of recent lottery pick Jalen Williams of the Oklahoma City Thunder. A pure scorer, he can produce 30 points on any given night. 
His spectacular play has catapulted Podziemski into the draft conversation, with upside of potentially a first-round selection.
The growth this season has been remarkable. He scored more points (30) in his Santa Clara debut than he did all of last season (22) at Illinois. Podziemski ended up scoring a total of 64 points in his first two games as a Bronco.
He's one of the best 3-point shooters in the country, but also has the size to generate his own shots in the mid-range and at the rim. From all three levels, he was a fantastic scorer all season as he showed off the smooth lefty stroke.
On the defensive end, he’s been disruptive as well, being one of the top producers of steals in the West Coast Conference. Podziemski has the size to defend multiple positions and has an energy that is contagious. 
One of the most underrated aspects of Podziemski’s game is the positional rebounding. As a guard, he’s pulled down more rebounds than most centers around he country do, which will be an attractive skill at the next level. 
He is an underrated facilitator, as Podziemski has led Santa Clara in assists all season. At the next level, he’ll have the ability to be a solid combo guard. He's able to fill up the stat sheet in a variety of ways. Podziemski is more than just a scorer, as his impact is felt in many aspects of the game. 
Perhaps the most exciting thing about the sophomore guard is his ability to get to the line. In the modern NBA, the best scorers have a knack for getting fouled and generating free throws. That means something to NBA teams.
Sometimes a new situation is exactly what prospects need, and that's proven to be the case for Podziemski as he's skyrocketed up draft boards since transferring to Santa Clara."
Cam Whitmore,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Caron Butler/Jae Crowder
Stengths:
Whitmore is a physically imposing young swingman with his 6’6 230 lb frame … Has at least adequate length with a sturdy build that will make his adjustment to the grown man leagues relatively seamless from a physical standpoint … Outstanding athleticism as well; gets up the floor in a hurry and has the explosive 2-footed leaping ability (whether on his 1st or 2nd jump) & powerful base to snag the ball at its apex even through contact … Shows very good body control … At his best going downhill as a driver; applies great pressure on the defense when operating with a head of steam (12.5 ppg on 47.8 FG% as a Fr) … Nice 1st step gives him advantages when matched up with bigger frontcourt players in space, and he has the wide frame to shield defenders and get angles early & with ease when slashing to the lane against smaller wings … Gets plenty of strong above the rim finishes and is among the best perimeter players in this draft class at converting in the paint amongst the trees (58 FG% inside the arc) … Has more finesse as a finisher than most would expect as well; being able to slither and contort into congested areas/around contests in the paint that are uncommon for burlier built wings in his mold..Effective off the ball and locates open spots as a cutter to get himself high percentage looks … Competitive and energetic; willing to match up and mix it up with bigger players in the paint … Has the physical tools and play style to see minutes anywhere from SG-PF at the pro level as he gains experience and polish … A “one move and go” penetrator who gets low and attacks when he sees daylight similarly to a running back … Patient; can freeze defenders with subtle hesitation moves and was effective slashing in either direction as a Fr … Not a bad shooter with his feet set (34 3FG%), and even utilizes jab steps to create space for shots off the bounce with reasonable success … Willing defender who denies penetration pretty well and actively contests shots … Shoots passing lanes (1.4 spg) and strips loose ball-handlers at the point of attack as well, showing strong hands … Will put up a fight before allowing players to establish position in the mid and low post; shows a junkyard dog mentality and embodies positionless basketball with his versatility…Solid rebounder for a primary wing (5.3 rpg) … An asset in the open court…A “young” Fr. who will turn 19 just after the 2023 Draft
Weaknesses:
His floor game is a bit rough around the edges right now; too often did not look comfortable creating efficient shots for himself let alone others as a Fr … Will slash into the lane with either no plan or pre-determined plans too often, leading to bad shots or the occasional turnover … Relies heavily on his physical and athletic ability to contribute, and it can be a struggle for him to fit in the flow of the game when you take away his strengths … Teams started to collapse on him when he slashed more & more as the season progressed, and his inexperience handling added attention showed in the way of him over-dribbling into no man’s land or having to shoot over multiple defenders suffocating his airspace … Average ball-handling skills; doesn’t have much wiggle or misdirection to his game off the dribble … Would benefit greatly from adding a floater/pull-up J to his repertoire to make his game less predictable; almost exclusively either shoots 3s or tries to barrel his way into the lane for better or worse … Doesn’t get much elevation on his shot and has a deliberate release, which limits the types of shots he can take and makes him easier for defenders to contest … His patience with the ball can straddle with being too deliberate; was often an indecisive ball-stopper who stagnated the team’s offensive flow this past season … Got his shots blocked more than you’d expect for someone with his tools … Below average court vision and doesn’t pass the ball much at all, with some around Villanova at times accusing him of being a selfish player (0.7 apg/1.4 topg) … Defensive awareness and overall fundamentals are a work in progress; tends to be overzealous looking to create turnovers and gave up more open shots than you’d like to see this past season by lunging for steals or losing his assignment when navigating through bodies … Somewhat stiff laterally, more of a straight-line mover … Only got to the FT line 64 times in 26 games (2.5 FTA/G) and converted on a mediocre 70% of those attempts … Not the sum of his parts yet, still green …
Overall:
Cam Whitmore is a 6’6 230 SF who committed to Villanova as a consensus 5-star recruit out of HS, and entered the 2022-2023 season with fanfare after winning MVP of the FIBA U18 tournament and leading the East in scoring (19 points) in a McDonalds AA game win … He suffered a preseason thumb injury that caused him to miss 7 games and seemingly contributed to an up-and-down Fr. season in nonconference and the Big East slate for a Nova team that was in Year 1 of the Kyle Neptune era after the retirement of the legendary long-time coach Jay Wright … Whitmore used his high-flying athleticism and physical style of play to lock up Big East Freshman of the Year honors putting up over 12 ppg and 5 rpg over 26 games … You cannot teach his physical/athletic tools, and he has promising ability as a spot-up shooter and off-ball player, as well as his overall toughness, willingness to rebound and defend the point of attack … He does show inexperience on both ends as well and may never be a primary scoring option that you’d expect if you’re selecting him in the top half of the lottery given some of the limitations with his shooting platform and creativity off the bounce, but he certainly has the upside to be a key, versatile role player if a team is patient with him and allows him time and reps to add polish and develop his floor game and fundamentals …

Evan Tomes 7/18/22  As documented last month, it has been an up-and-down season for Villanova (16-15) and Whitmore, the Wildcats' highly touted freshman. They'll need to win three more games in three days at the Big East tournament to avoid missing the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2012. Nevertheless, there's a lot to like about what Whitmore offers from a physical standpoint and the flashes he has shown as a shot-creator and shot-maker.

Additionally, he doesn't turn 19 until July. After Whitmore played some of his best basketball over the past few games, NBA teams hope to see him progress as a passer, perimeter shooter and defender in what are likely to be the final games of his college career. Those are all areas he has been inconsistent with this season. How much urgency Whitmore has to offer under the bright lights of Madison Square Garden will be a point of interest, as his intensity level disappointed at times this season.-- Jonathan Givony  Whitmore is one of the best prospects in this entire class while also being one of the youngest. In fact, he’ll still be 18 years old on draft night. While he was injured to start his college career, he quickly showed why he is a lottery talent.
With a strong frame and body that’s ready for the NBA, the 6-foot-7 wing was one of the best athletes in the country last season. He plays with power and energy that sticks out when he’s on the floor.
In a class that’s loaded with combo forwards, Whitmore was easily one of the best. As such, there’s a real chance he goes as high as No. 5 overall in the 2023 NBA Draft.
Whether it’s in transition or in a half court set, Whitmore leverages his strength and weight to bully this opponents. He has proven to be able to get to the rim any time he wants to when his team needs a bucket. From there, he’s got the body control to finish difficult layups as well as the vertical pop to dunk on his opponent. As a high school star, Whitmore was known for putting guys on posters.
Even without the ball in his hands, Whitmore is good at getting to his spots. He’s a great cutter and has a nose for pulling down offensive rebounds. Not only is he a fantastic athlete, but he’s one of those guys that’s always in the right place at the right time.
As an actual ball handler, Whitmore does have room to improve. With that in mind, he’s shifty and has a good change of pace that throws defenders off. He’s more of a violent, aggressive attacker than a skilled dribbler.
Whitmore is much improved as a shooter, but there’s still questions about if he’s put together sustainable numbers. The jumper is fluid, but he doesn’t get much lift off the ground. Regardless, he shot nearly 35% from deep as a freshman which is great for his projection to play on the wing at the next level.
The 6-foot-7 prospect has the ability to take games over offensively which is where his star upside shows. He’s good good vision but hasn’t generated high assist numbers to this point, which was somewhat concerning last season. A versatile player on both ends, Whitmore is a natural wing that can play down as an off-ball guard or up as a power forward.
Whitmore is a really good rebounder that can also push the ball up the floor after pulling it down. This is what results in a ton of transition points for his team.
The 18-year-old is a tough, versatile defender that leverages his frame and strength to guard multiple positions. He isn’t an elite defender but that end of the floor is not a negative part of his game either. Whitmore isn’t the most laterally quick, but can defend bigger wings and forwards well inside of the perimeter. It will be interesting to see him against quicker guards on the perimeter at the NBA level.
A five-star recruit, Whitmore was a McDonald’s All-American out of Archbishop Spalding High School. He really broke out and began to improve his draft stock before he even got to Villanova following a spectacular showing at the 2022 FIBA U18 Americas Championship, where he was named MVP and showcased efficient perimeter shooting numbers. He proved he was one of the best young prospects in the world at this event.
If Whitmore is able to put together an impressive pre-draft process, he’ll be a potential top-five pick this summer."
Dariq Whitehead,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Anthony Morrow
Strengths:
One of the premier shooters in college basketball as a freshman at 43% on over three attempts per game … Efficient from beyond the arc both in spot-ups and off the dribble … Fluid shooting motion with a textbook high release … Excellent frame at 6’7 with a wingspan just over 6’10 … Filled out body at 217 pounds with a powerful lower half … Solid first step and flexible hip movement allow him to create remarkable space for himself before even putting the ball on the floor …  Complements this movement with a polished step back jumper that he can bury from both inside and outside the 3-point arc … Intelligent cutter from the corner and wing … Uses long strides and terrific body control to attack the basket and slither around contact … Switchable, active defender who has the length and athleticism to guard multiple positions … Not only has the length to disrupt action as a defender, but also possesses the instincts and quickness to read and jump passing lanes as an off-ball defender … Active hands as an on-ball defender who can frustrate ball-handlers trying to move across his body … Decent free throw shooter at just under 80% … Assist numbers were low, but the flashes of accurate passing and court vision are certainly there … One of the youngest players in the draft turning 19 on August 1st …
Weaknesses:
Despite coming in as one of the top recruits in the nation, Whitehead struggled to carve out a role for himself … Athleticism never looked right, was a step slow and unable to explode, most likely due to a foot injury that was lingering all season … Was most affected with his inability to get any lift when leaping and it had a clear effect on his ability to dunk and rebound … Grew more comfortable over time, but his inside-the-arc shot creation never flourished with the Blue Devils … A 41% shooting percentage from 2-point range supports that … Negative AST/TO ratio with 27 assists to 39 turnovers … Needs to be more aggressive offensively. Attempted only 28 free throws in 28 games for the Blue Devils as a freshman … Also needs to show more aggression on the glass with just 2.4 rebounds per game … A fractured foot in the pre-season certainly played a large role, and his in-game leaping ability became a major hindrance at Duke … He had a second foot surgery after the season that has made it impossible for him to work out for teams, so his feasibility as a first round pick is likely something organizations will have to discuss with their team doctors in order to figure out …
Outlook:
With such a premium put on shooting in today’s NBA, it makes Whitehead an obvious gamble in the late first round that he can rehabilitate his foot injury and regain the explosiveness that made him one of the top 5 prospects nationally in his class for most of his high school career … If Whitehead is unable to regain some of his pre-college explosiveness, it’s unlikely he will be able to have a productive pro career …
Notes:
Measured: 6′ 5.75” barefoot, 8′ 7.50” standing reach, 217.2 lbs, and a 6′ 10.25” wingspan at the 2023 NBA Draft Combine … Five-star recruit from Newark, NJ … 2022 Naismith High School Player of the Year and All-American Player of the Year (SI) … McDonald’s All-American Game MVP … Led Montverde Academy to back-to-back HS National Championships … Played on Nike EYBL circuit in 2021 and USA Basketball Junior National Team in 2019 … Missed eight games with injuries at Duke … Averaged just 8.3 PTS with the Blue Devils as a FR …

Aware off the ball and jumps passes. Stays in a stance and defends well on the ball. Solid shot blocker and defensive versatility for position … Even keeled demeanor and always under control … Carries himself well and has a professional approach … High floor … Younger for his class, will turn 18 in August of his freshman year of college …
Weaknesses:
Can improve shooting and finishing consistency and efficiency in all areas. Tends to release his shot on the way down. Shot 68.4% FT% and 31.5% 3PT% on 4.9 attempts per game over the Nike EYBL in 2021. Shot 41% FG%, 32% 3PT% on 6.8 attempts per game, and 63% FT% in the NIBC in 2021-22. On the negative side of streaky shooting, he’s had games where his contribution was less than desired … Limited creativity and can expand his offensive game in the half-court. Reliant and settles for pull-ups, sometimes contested, and can work on getting to the rim more often … Solid passing ability but not too advanced. Ball-handling can improve as well, especially with his left hand …
Outlook:
Duke commit … 2022 McDonald’s All-American MVP with 13 points (5-10 FG, 3-7 3PT), 7 rebounds, and 7 assists … Played in the 2022 Jordan Brand Classic … Recorded 17 points (6-12 FG, 5-7 3PT), 5 rebounds, 4 assists, and 3 steals in the 2022 Nike Hoop Summit … Helped Montverde to win the 2022 Geico Nationals with 14 points and 6 assists in the championship game … 2022 Naismith Prep Player of the Year … 2022 Florida Gatorade Player of the Year …
Evan Tomes 5/26/22  Whitehead's season was marred early by injuries, and he hasn't been able to carve out as a big role as expected even recently when healthy, playing 16 minutes per game off the bench over the past six games. Despite shooting 40% for 3 and showing strong flashes defensively, Whitehead's struggles as a decision-maker, creator and finisher have made it difficult for him to gain traction and solidify his candidacy as a first-round prospect, as there are real questions about his lack of explosiveness and ability to generate efficient offense. NBA teams say they'd like to see a lot more from Whitehead against the high-level competition the NCAA tournament offers to help reconcile his lofty standing entering college with the underwhelming production we've seen thus far.-- Jonathan Givony  Entering his freshman season at Duke, Dariq Whitehead had extremely high expectations. He was arguably the top player in his high school class last season, showing off a unique blend of explosiveness and size. It's rare to see such a great athlete be so smooth with the ball in his hands.
Not only does Whitehead have good positional size, but he's also got a solid wingspan. As such, he should be able to guard multiple positions at the next level. He's got the tools to be a really good defender at the college and NBA level, but we'll see what he looks like early this season with an increase in the level of competition.
When it comes to scoring, the 6-foot-6 wing has no problem getting to the rim and finishing through contact. He's also got a smooth jumper, although his release is somewhat slow at this point. If he's going to reach his ceiling as a shooter, he'll likely need to get the ball off quicker. With that in mind, Whitehead does have a high release point and good elevation, which should play to his advantage. He's also shown flashes of scoring in the midrange as well.
Entering his freshman season at Duke, there was no question that Whitehead was more than likely going to be a one-and-done prospect. While that's still the case, he wasn't as good as we expected. This was mostly due to injuries and never being able to get into a groove, but it certainly wasn't a dominant freshman campaign for the wing. He ended up starting in just seven games and played just over 20 minutes per contest. 
If there's one thing he did show that will improve his chance of being selected early in the first round of the 2023 NBA Draft, it's the perimeter shooting as he knocked down almost 43% of his triples on high volume. 
The 2022 Naismith Boy's High School Player of the Year, Whitehead simply dominated his competition in his final high school season. He's mentally prepared to play on the biggest stage with an extreme amount of confidence that he's the best player any time he takes the floor. While he isn't a primary facilitator today, he does also have the ability to pass well for his position. 
His brother, Tahir Whitehead, has been in the NFL for the past decade as a linebacker. The Duke wing was a football standout himself before committing to basketball full time and is ready for the NBA from a physical standpoint. The New Jersey native has played basketball at the highest level for a while now, which should make his transition to college and then to the NBA that much easier. 
Whitehead played for Montverde Academy in high school, which is one of the top schools in the country. As an underclassman, he had the chance to play on the same team as several current NBA players such as Scottie Barnes, Cade Cunningham, Moses Moody, DayRon Sharpe and RJ Barrett.
During his senior season, Whitehead led Montverde to win the 2022 GEICO Nationals and put on a show in the championship game."
Noah Clowney,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Theo Ratliff
Strengths:
Clowney is a sleek and mobile 6’10 210 C/PF who fits the mold of what teams look for in modern day bigs/frontcourt guys and has the frame to add significant mass … Runs the floor well and shows pretty solid leaping skills with a head of steam, making him a promising transition player on both ends of the court … Very rangy and long (reportedly has a 7’2 wingspan); can cover massive ground on the move and is a hard player to get shots over which makes him a promising frontcourt defensive player … Good timing as a shot-blocker (0.9 BPG), particularly as a help defender; can get his hands on shots at the highest point … Has the tools to switch and guard on the perimeter as he gains experience, and showed nice flashes of ability to be disruptive with his length against smaller players as a Fr … Has some of the best numbers in this draft class as a finisher in close, and is a player who can convert above the rim or with some finesse (67 FG% inside the arc) … Good hands & reflexes to grab both rebounds (8 RPG) and errant passes outside of his area … Solid on the offensive glass … Likes to face-up and has soft touch & 3-point range on his shot, with the potential to be a solid producer as a spot-up threat in time (34 made 3s as a Fr.) … Feel for the game is ahead of your typical raw bigman prospect; generally doesn’t force action or try to play outside of his role/strengths … Hustles and is a willing cutter who gets rewarded with alley-oops and dumpoffs … Likes to set screens and get himself shots by rolling to the rim or popping out for jumpers, making him a player who can feed off teammates and chip in as a scorer without having to create for himself directly (9.8 PPG) … Form on his shot give his scoring and shooting a lot of intrigue, despite unimpressive efficiency … May just be scratching the surface of the talent he possesses; more of a late blooming, diamond in the rough type who could grow into an important player with more experience … A ‘young’ Fr. who will just be turning 19 years old shortly after the 2023 Draft …
Weaknesses:
Needs to fill out his frame and improve his base strength and toughness; got knocked backwards when met with contact often at the college level by bigs and some wings, which doesn’t bode well taking a step up in competition … Sometimes can be overly reliant on his length to bail himself out defensively, and can be neutralized when slashers get into his chest/body which leads to fouls (2.5 FPG) … More of a linear run-jump athlete than a lateral mover due to his high center of gravity; really needs to work on sinking his hips and sliding his feet consistently … Bit of a ‘tweener’ big at the moment; could struggle with quickness switching in space on the perimeter and from some NBA PFs but also may struggle with the physicality of some NBA Cs … A face-up frontcourt guy but doesn’t show much handling the ball or creating offense … Haven’t seen him show much as a post scorer either; won’t have many plays drawn up for him … Shot looks solid fundamentally, but the efficiency is still improving as of now (28.3 3FG% on 3.3 3FGA/G) … Doesn’t pass the ball much (0.8 APG) … Drew fouls at an OK rate but needs improvement converting at the line once he gets there (65 FT% on 3.1 FTA/G) … Pretty green, not yet the sum of his parts …
Overall:
Noah Clowney has been one of the fastest risers in the 2023 Draft Class relative to draft stock before the 22-23 NCAA hoops season over the past half dozen months, putting himself on the radar largely from an impressive 16 point, 11 rebound performance against then-1st ranked Houston early in the season … Clowney was a 4-star recruit in 2022 but was overshadowed by Bama’s other more touted recruits (including potential top 3 pick Brandon Miller), only to start all 36 games as a Fr and finish 3rd on the team in scoring and minutes, and 2nd in rebounds and blocks … Clowney showed good athleticism as a finisher, while also showing potential as a shooter and defensive player with his long arms and range … He will need to get stronger and add mass to his frame to rectify certains nuances to his game, as well as gaining polish and experience on both ends of the court … Still, the groundwork is there for Clowney to keep improving over time and tweaking certain skills and fundamentals … He could develop into a role-player who doesn’t need the ball to be effective at his best, given his shooting touch and potential impact on defense as he grows … Clowney is one of the youngest prospects in the 2023 Draft class, and his range is likely somewhere in the top 35, with him possibly being selected as early as the late teens in the 1st round …
Jorrye Nixon 6/7/23  Clowney propelled himself into one-and-done conversations by playing an integral role for arguably the best team in college basketball, despite being one of the youngest freshmen in the class. He fits a clear NBA mold as a mobile, long-armed, high-energy big man with legit floor-spacing ability and outstanding defensive versatility. He plays a mature style that bodes well for his long-term outlook as his thin frame continues to evolve over time. Clowney's productivity and perimeter shooting have been inconsistent, but he has played some of his best games against high-level competition, which bodes well for Alabama as it moves into the most important games of its season.-- Jonathan Givony  One of the biggest risers over the course of the season, Clowney is a surprising potential one-and-done prospect. Although he looked somewhat overwhelmed at points early in the season, he’s getting more comfortable. With each game, he continues to grow and shot positive signs of development.
In the biggest moments of the season, Clowney has played some of his best games. This is extremely promising for a guy that will still be 18 on the night of the 2023 NBA Draft and is one of the youngest players in the country.
The 6-foot-10 forward is definitely more raw than some of his peers that will get first-round interest, but the ceiling is high. At the next level, he projects to be a mobile big, playing mostly at forward but also capable of being a center situationally. As of today, we don’t see the skillset to slide down to a more traditional wing, but that’s fine given his size.
Clowney is one of the most efficient scorers in the country inside the arc. He’s got good touch near rim and finishes well with both hands.
The freshman is also a solid positional shooter from deep, but has room to improve in that aspect of the game. He’s already good enough to force defenders to respect his perimeter shot, but emerging as a legitimate floor spacer would elevate his stock. Regardless, Clowney is a willing shooter from beyond the arc and takes multiple attempts per game, which is promising even if his efficiency wasn't very high. Everything points to him having upside as a 3-point shooter at the NBA level.
When thinking about how his offensive game translates at the next level, he could be a really good screener that keeps defenses scrambling due to his ability to roll or pop following the pick action.
While the jumper is impressive for a player of his size, Clowney is a poor free throw shooter. At the NBA level, this will have to be fixed if he’s going to be a player that can be trusted to get minutes down the stretch.
With his size and athleticism, Clowney is also a really good rebounder. He uses his tools well to clean the glass, which makes him a potential double-double machine longer term.
As promising as the offensive versatility is, Clowney’s real upside is on the defensive end. That’s where his ceiling gets really interesting. He can really impact the game on that end both in the paint and on the perimeter.
As a rim protector, Clowney has shown the ability to block shots with good timing. He does struggle against bigger, stronger centers in the paint, but has good instincts overall.
On the perimeter, he uses his long arms to force deflections and steals. When defending smaller guards, Clowney has been inconsistent but still impressive. Sometimes he looks like a guy that can hold his own on the perimeter against quicker players, but other times his feet move extremely slow and the lack of lateral quickness is apparent. It’s all about staying balanced for the young forward.
Clowney still has a long way to go from a physical standpoint, as he needs to fill out and get stronger. This would help him on both ends, but it’s clear he could struggle early at the NBA level if he were still this size.
Overall, he doesn’t project to be a star at the NBA level, but could be a really valuable piece of a team’s top end rotation. The former four-star recruit wasn’t the biggest name entering college, but is proving that he’s underrated.
Playing on an extremely talented Alabama team alongside Brandon Miller was the primary reason Clowney’s role wasn't huge as a freshman. There simply wasn't many games in which he’s the primary scoring option.

At this point, it will be interesting to see how the pre-draft process goes for Clowney. He will absolutely get first-round consideration, but could also come back for his sophomore season and attempt to further solidify himself as a future lottery pick."
Kris Murray,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Dorian Finney-Smith
Strengths:
A 6’9 225 SF/PF southpaw with the size (6-11 wingspan), mobility and length to play all along the frontcourt, especially as he fills out his frame…Pretty agile and moves well laterally, and isn’t a bad leaper off one or both feet … Has a nose for the ball and a knack for scoring in chunks; opportunistic and doesn’t necessarily need plays drawn up for him to make his mark in the scoring column … Let’s the game come to him and rarely forces bad shots…Good court awareness and knows how to find open spots and get easy shots as a cutter or navigating along the perimeter playing off his teammates’ dribble penetration … Possesses very good hands and has been a magnet for offensive rebounds this year for Iowa (2.8 orpg); seemingly has missed shots that are tipped or rimmed out fall into his lap every game … Enjoying a breakout season as a Jr. after being a per-minute savant as the teams 6th man during his Soph. season, and has seen his scoring totals double with more playing time (9.7 to 20.4 ppg, both on 48 FG%) … A career 35 3FG% that has 3-level scoring ability, and possesses a soft touch with consistent mechanics … Has the size to shoot over most wings with ease…Is a versatile mismatch threat with his offensive package and has played minutes everywhere from SF-C in Iowa’s spaced out scheme … Shows above average footwork and quickness around the rim and does a nice job utilizing up-and-unders and occasional spin moves to create space for himself (shooting 59% inside the arc as a Jr.) … Nice floater and 1-2 dribble pull up when chased off the line … Has especially enjoyed major success off the bounce facing up the big guys in the Big 10, who are notoriously lumbering, by getting them to respect his jumper and forcing them to defend him away from the basket … Not selfish; looks to initiate transition opportunities after rebounds and is comfortable handling and dishing in the open court … Runs the floor and can finish above the rim in the open court … Continues to steadily improve as a defender; has been more aggressive using his length and timing to challenge shots (1.2 bpg) and step out on the perimeter to hedge screens or switch and smother smaller ball-handlers this year … Smart player who does a good job taking care of the ball, especially considering his massive role in Iowa’s offense, and usually seems under control (2/1.5 A/TO, 0.9 topg for his career) … Will be compared to his twin brother and rookie 2022 lottery pick Keegan often in the draft process, especially considering their similar play styles and respective breakthrough seasons happened in nearly identical ways (no pun intended) …
Weaknesses:
Murray wont be confused with a physical player and is clearly more finesse than a junkyard dog type … Should look to add more strength, though he does covert through contact at an adequate rate … Not quite as prolific a shooter as his brother and doesn’t show the same consistency from deep (34 3FG% as a Jr after 38% as a Soph.) … Had 3 games where he shot 0-5 or worse from deep … Doesn’t always have the same success breaking down the defense when defended by wings or other physically similar PFs that he does when playing as a smallball 5 … Not more than average as a ball-handler on the perimeter, has some misdirection but his moves can be timed by other wings … Clearly prefers to go with his left hand when driving and finishing more than his off-hand; had the quickness to avoid major issues with that approach in college but will have more problems with that against NBA defenders, particularly against help … Had his moments (ie 20 rebound game against GA Tech) but is mostly an area rebounder on the defensive end and finished the season with just OK production on the glass after missed shots despite heavy minutes at the PF/C spot (5.1 DRPG) … Older than usual for his class; will be 23 years old as a rookie which will call into question his overall upside … Struggled in his one tourney game (as Missouri’s featured player) with 15 and 9, but shot just 5-18 overall and 3-11 from deep …
Overall:
For a 3rd straight season Iowa has a frontcourt player who lights up the scoreboard as a 20 ppg star in their offense-friendly system … Kris Murray went from a productive 6th man playing limited minutes and watching his twin brother be the top scorer last year in a breakthrough All-America season to enjoying an All-American season of his own … Murray didn’t quite put up the scoring totals as his twin brother Keegan (23.5 ppg vs 20.4) despite playing more minutes, but their ascensions both were eerily similar and they have the same type of mismatch skills, moves and sweet jumpers that open up their entire scoring arsenal … Kris could stand to gain more consistency as a shooter, as well as continuing to polish his floor game off the dribble, but his growth speaks to a hard worker who understands how to build on his skills … He patiently waited his turn and earned his minutes, and now has experience playing as a role player and a star … He is older for his class, but that may play into his hands just fine as he could benefit from being selected by a team that likes his gaudy numbers and wants a combo forward that they prefer to plug and play immediately in their lineup/rotation…He seems to have solidified his spot as a 1st round selection and he could knock on the door of being a lottery pick …
Notes:
Measured 6′ 7.75” barefoot, 8′ 10.00” standing reach, 212.8 lbs and a 6′ 11.75” wingspan and a 29.5 inch standing vertical and a 35′ inch max vertical at the 2023 NBA Draft Combine …
Jorrye Nixon 3/22/23  Murray has improved significantly over the past two seasons, becoming a first-team All-Big Ten player and one of the most versatile defenders in the class. Murray doesn't quite have one consistent means of scoring but is solid across the board, being an acceptable, albeit streaky, perimeter shooter with a good feel for the game who can push off the defensive glass, score in the post and move off the ball resourcefully. Murray's aggressiveness and toughness comes and goes some, and he is much older than most first-round prospects, set to 23 in August, so finding a way to finish strong and staying productive after coming up short in last year's NCAA tournament will be beneficial.-- Jonathan Givony

The twin brother of Sacramento Kings rookie Keegan Murray, Kris Murray is projected to follow in his footsteps and become a first-round draft pick. Going back to school for his junior season, Murray showed rapid development and rose up draft boards over the past few months just like his twin did a year ago.
After not playing much as a freshman at Iowa, Murray had a solid sophomore campaign. Known for being a 3-point shooter, he knocked down nearly 40% of his triples as a sophomore season. While his efficiency went down as a junior, he shot on much higher volume and got more attention from defenses. What's most impressive about Murray is that he shoots so well while standing at 6-foot-8 and is also solid on the defensive end.
At this point, it doesn't appear Murray has the same overall upside as his brother, but does project to be a quality role player at the NBA level. He's got great size for a 3-and-D wing and also has a ton of experience under his belt. The fact that he will be 23 at the start of the 2023-24 NBA season will limit his ceiling on draft night, but still could help a playoff team immediately. 
Some prospects play the game in a way that doesn't truly allow them to flourish without opportunity, which is the case for Murray. In the past, he was often hidden by high level teammates, but was able to thrive as more of a primary option this season.
Combo forwards that are fundamentally sound are typically good rotation players at the next level. Murray has proven to be effective on the wing or as a stretch four and can also defend a variety of positions. He's a much improved rebounder and is actually an underrated playmaker. 
As good as the shooting is for Murray, it does come in waves. Building on consistency as a shooter will be key in his development moving forward. During the pre-draft process, he will have plenty of opportunity to showcase the upside from beyond the arc.
After entering the 2022 NBA Draft without representation, Murray made a smart move by going back to play one more college season. His stock has definitely increased and he is now ready to make the jump to the next level. 
One question for Murray entering year three at the college level was his free throw shooting, which was much improved and also helps make his case as a shooter at the next level. He also got better at creating contact and getting to the line while also nearly doubling his assist numbers. All of these areas of improvement are why he now looks like a clear first-round selection in the 2023 NBA Draft."

NBA Comparison: Al Thornton
Strengths:
This man is strong. Long bodied forward who throws it down with authority, plays ferocious, tenacious defense, and is an interested and developing outside shooter … Excellent length, strength, and versatility. 7’1″ wingspan in a 6’8″ frame … When Prosper puts the ball on the floor it’s not the most fluid looking thing in the world. But he is able to impose his will (and strength) on the other team and get to the hole … Can reasonably be expected to defend positions 2-4 on ball, at minimum … The 3p shot is a relatively recent addition to his arsenal, but it is there, and continues to develop (34% this past season at Marquette) … At Marquette he was roughly a 76% FT shooter, proving he does have some shooting touch … Don’t let his basic box score stats fool you: A cornerstone of Prosper’s game is his defensive impact. He averaged a mind-bogglingly low 0.1 blocks per game across his entire college career, and less than 1 steal per game. However, his reputation is deserved — he is a dog on the defensive end … Very powerful, moves his feet well, applies constant pressure… About 1/3 of his rebounds were offensive rebounds…
Weaknesses:
Maybe we list blocks and steals as an area for improvement … They don’t tell the full defensive story, but they do at least play some part. And Prosper’s numbers in both were remarkably low in college … The 3-point shot is a relatively recent addition to his arsenal, and he is not yet a reliable outside shooter … While he is fairly accurate from mid-range, he will need to continue developing here and from outside to reach a level close to a Siakam type …
Shot mechanics can improve … Often catches without his feet set, slowing his release … Takes a while to transfer the catch into the shot … Has not displayed much passing or playmaking ability … Turns the ball over at too high a rate … Has decent, but developing touch after a jump stop into a hook shot / floater in the lane … NOT overly quick. He is quite methodical in his movements … Rebounding numbers were underwhelming for a long athletic post player …
Overall:
Had standout measurements and athletic performance at the combine. Finished top-5 in nearly every athletic test (such as max vert). The 7’1″ wingspan in the 6’8″ frame is a big positive. Stylistically, he’s not the most fluid mover … He is a little harsh with his steps and change of direction. But also extremely powerful for his size, you rarely see him get knocked off balance — more likely he’s abusing his defender with his strength. A menace as an on ball defender and can be expected to guard most positions on the floor … Gives great effort. Despite not passing the eye test as a fluid mover, he does get to his spots, and is an effective finisher from 2-point range … As he develops his mid-range and 3-point shooting, he can turn into a viable option on the offensive end… His calling card, especially initially and probably always, will be his impact defensively …
Notes:
Measured 6′ 6.75” barefoot, 8′ 8” standing reach, 212.4 lbs and a 7′ 1” wingspan and a 35 inch standing vertical and a 40.5′ inch max vertical at the 2023 NBA Draft Combine … From Montreal, Canada …  Played one year at Clemson before transferring to Marquette, where he played two seasons … Sister, Cassandre, is one of top-ranked basketball prospects in Canada  … Both parents played at Concordia University in Montreal … Mom played for Team Canada … There is some precedent of hard nosed players “over achieving” in the pros from Marquette, let’s see if Prosper will follow suit.
Drew Wolin 6/18/23  The 6-foot-8 Prosper, the No. 32 prospect in the ESPN 100 posted 21 points and 7 rebounds in 22 minutes in his lone game at the draft combine and conducted a well-attended pro day in Los Angeles on Tuesday where several NBA executives told ESPN they were impressed with his perimeter shooting and explosiveness. He participated in five individual workouts with NBA teams before the combine and now has a busy schedule the next four weeks that will see him visit most of the teams picking in the first round. Prosper fits a prototype many NBA teams are actively seeking with his ability to play either forward spot as his perimeter shooting (34% from 3 last season) continues to evolve. -- Jonathan Givony  At 6-foot-8 and 230 pounds, Prosper has ideal size for a modern perimeter player in the NBA. He is a 20-year-old from Montreal, Canada that has made his way to college basketball through the NBA Academy Latin America. The draw for a prospect like Prosper is that he is a multi-skilled offensive player, with a developing shot, that is willing to embrace his role while at the same time playing extremely hard on the defensive end and providing versatility.
On the offensive end, this value begins with Prosper’s ability to attack the basket. He will have to be able to make catch and shoot or pick-and-pop attempts to provide gravity and floor spacing to have success at the next level. More importantly, he is at his best when he can attack closeouts and attack the paint. The 6-foot-8 wing does not possess a ton of wiggle to his game and is more of a straight line driver and those opportunities will usually come from a closing out defender.
With each college season, Prosper improved as a 3-point shooter and has good mechanics. He simply has to continue to elevate the numbers of attempts and the efficiency he is knocking them down if he is going to reach his NBA ceiling. His ability to showcase a promising perimeter shot in the pre-draft process will really increase his stock.
Prosper does show some promise in some tertiary skills for his role. By no means is he a primary, or even secondary, creator but the flashing passes are good enough for his size and position. While his subtle movements along the 3-point line could improve, his overall off ball movement is impressive. He shows good patience in waiting for the right time to make his cut to the rim and then finding the open spot to cut to for the attempt.
When it comes down to it, NBA teams will really value Prosper for his defensive upside. At 6-foot-8, it was impressive to watch him play at the front of the Shaka Smart full court press and hound smaller guards. While this assuredly will not be something he is asked to do on an NBA court, it still displays his willingness and abilities to give multiple efforts, change direction and stay with smaller players in the open floor. It’s one thing to be able to defend these types of players on the ball but Prosper also showcases an ability to chase them through and around off ball screens.
If Prosper is going to really emerge as an elite defensive prospect, the last thing he needs to improve upon is rim protection. He’ll be switchable at the next level, with paint presence really being the primary thing he lacks on that end. He does a nice job with rotations but he simply does not have the knack for getting blocks or protecting the rim.
The jury is also still out on just how many positions Prosper will be able to guard in the NBA. With his frame, it is interesting to see him struggle at times to hold up in the paint and wall off offensive players. Prosper is far from a sure thing in the 2023 NBA Draft and very well may have to return to school and enter in 2024, but even then there is no doubt he is an intriguing prospect to keep an eye on.

One of the better prospects to come out of Canada recently, the former four-star recruit has what it takes on both ends to become a solid 3-and-D wing in the NBA. As a connecting piece in the right role, he has the positional size and athleticism to make a real impact. Basketball is in Prosper’s genes, as both of his parents played college ball up north and his mother even represented Team Canada in 1997."
Marcus Sasser,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Jevon Carter
Strengths:
Sasser is a 6’2 PG/SG with solid length (6’7 wingspan) and quickness on the perimeter; along with above average footwork, body control and agility … His perimeter J is his bread and butter offensively, where he shot 37% on a robust 7 3-point attempts per game for his career … Has NBA range, a smooth release & follow through, and unabashed confidence … Very comfortable taking deep shots pulling off the dribble going left or right, and is also a really consistent threat spotting up in rhythm with space … Shows wiggle and space creation skill and likes to utilize step-back jumpers…Had 11 games with 4+ made 3-point shots as a Sr, illustrating his ability to score in bunches with his jumper…Effective utilizing runners when chased off the line; a necessity for players who lack size … Career 82 FT% (85 FT% as a Sr on a career-high 4.2 FTA/G); won’t make many mistakes from the stripe late in games … Takes care of the ball and limits live ball turnovers (1.4 topg for his career) … Can operate in pick and roll offense adequately enough to not look out of place chipping in as a secondary playmaker; uses pace dribbles and the threat of his jumper to create passing lanes for occasional dump-offs to bigs … Decent transition player who can be used as a shooting valve off ball or occasionally applying pressure calling his own number getting downhill … Competitive defensive player who has the length and lateral quickness to cut off penetration, stagnate offensive possessions and force turnovers (1.6 spg) … Among the best point of attack perimeter defenders in the 2023 Draft class, but also shows solid awareness navigating through screens and can disrupt passing lanes off the ball…May see his efficiency rise at the pro level with less shot-creation responsibilities …
Weaknesses:
Average athleticism as he lacks much in the way of explosiveness and leaping skills … Below average physical profile outside of his relatively long arms, not being particularly impressive with his height, strength or frame … Shoots a ton of jumpers and has a tendency to settle and take ill-advised, closely contested shots … Doesn’t get to the rim very often in half-court offense and struggles to convert amongst the trees in the paint once he gets there due to a lack of elevation … Much more wired to score than facilitate; doesn’t show great playmaking instincts and usually prefers to use screens to get space for his own shots … Handled the ball a ton in college and doesn’t project to see nearly as many possessions for himself at the NBA level … Doesn’t break down the defense often enough in isolation to justify extended on-ball responsibilities, and had possessions when he pounded the ball too much when he should’ve swung it to his teammates … Middling efficiency (around 44 FG% his final 2 college seasons, career 40 FG%) and can be a bit streaky with his shot … Some durability concerns after missing parts of 2 seasons dealing with toe and groin injuries …
Overall:
Marcus Sasser had a decorated 4-year career in the AAC with Houston, winning a ton of games and capping his career off with an All-American Sr. season, CPOY award and a Jerry West award for the best SG in college hoops … While Sasser had nice offensive production over his career, he also is not afraid to get his hands dirty on the defensive end, and he has good projections as a pesky perimeter defensive player at the pro level who, at his best, can pressure the ball and force offenses to set up much further out than they would like … Sasser figures to be limited more at the pro level by his lack of size and athleticism than in college, particularly as a finisher and overall shot-creator, but he has the off-ball shooting prowess and pick and roll skills to function alongside more ball-dominant players and he really may benefit from reduced on-ball duties and become a solid contributor in some team’s backcourt as he gets adjusted … Sasser has been projected as a 2nd round pick with the chance to be picked in the late 1st by a playoff team that could use his shooting, defense and experience in the backcourt, and his college pedigree will definitely lend him some favor with teams …
Measured:
6’1.25” barefoot, 6’2.75” in shoes, 8’1.5” standing reach, 192.6 lbs, 6’7.0” wingspan at the 2022 NBA G-League Elite Camp … Measured 6′ 1.25” barefoot, 8′ 3.50” standing reach, 195.6 lbs and a 6′ 7.00” wingspan and a 27 inch standing vertical and a 35′ inch max vertical at the 2023 NBA Draft Combine …
Jorrye Nixon 5/29/23  Sasser, battling a groin injury, gutted out one of his best performances of the season relative to the stakes, hitting 5-for-9 3s for Houston en route to 22 points against Auburn. Sasser's shot-making ability was on full display, hitting a difficult transition pull-up 3, two snatchback 3s out of isolation to punish the switching big man, and then icing the game with a tough corner 3 off movement.

Sasser looked somewhat hobbled pushing in the open court and especially staying in front of the lightning-quick Wendell Green, but that was to be expected considering his injury. How healthy he's able to get in the coming days as Houston takes on Miami and then the winner of Xavier/Texas should they advance will be huge for its Final Four chances, as a strong performance will surely help his cause for first-round pick consideration on draft night. -- Jonathan Givony  After declaring for the 2022 NBA Draft, Sasser made the decision to come back for one more season with a loaded Houston team. After dealing with a toe injury last season, he was healthy for most of this year which was promising.

A smaller combo guard, Sasser is known for scoring points. He’s got a great shot and is extremely effective from deep. The 6-foot-2 guard is an advanced shot maker on the perimeter and converts on very high level triples.
Sasser is much more than a catch-and-shoot guy. He operates well off the dribble and can shoot on the move. With that in mind, he’s also ultra effective when he is in catch-and-shoot situations. One negative on his shot is that he does bring the ball down to his waist upon the catch which slows down his release. Additionally, the further from the basket Sasser gets, the more he loads up and dips in his shooting motion to use his legs which also slows down the shot.
Outside of being a shooter, the Houston prospect can also score in other ways. Sasser has good moves off the bounce and is effective in the midrange with a solid floater game. He’s got work to do near the rim, but his jump shooting is what makes him stand out.
We’d like to see him get all the way to the rim more often and prove he’s effective there. Sasser been ineffective to this point driving to the cup, which is why he typically settles for a midrange shot instead of taking it all the way to the rack. When he does drive all the way to the rim, he tends to get tunnel vision and misses open teammates on the perimeter
Scoring overall is what Sasser brings to the table. He truly catalyzes the team’s offense when he’s on the floor. He doesn’t have an elite first step or the most crafty dribble moves, but is still able to generate good looks in isolation
Despite being shorter, Sasser can hold his own defensively. He measured out with a 6-foot-7 wingspan at the recent combine and has really quick hands. Sasser also moves laterally very well, boasting strong defensive footwork. He works hard through screens and gives full effort defensively, always staying low and balanced.
One of the best teams in the country this season, Houston had scouts watching closely all season long, especially with freshman Jarace Walker in the mix. Betting on himself and playing another college season didn't necessarily pay off for Sasser in terms of stock relative to last season, but he would still be a great pick up in the second round."
Ben Sheppard,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Garrett Temple
Strengths:
An impactful 3-and-D wing who was outstanding in his four seasons at Belmont on both sides of the ball … Showed out in NBA Combine scrimmages, which included a 25-point game, one-point shy of an NBA Combine record … Smooth and efficient shooting stroke from beyond the arc at 41.5% as a senior … Showed impressive confidence initiating the offense and creating his own shot off the dribble at the NBA Combine. Decent playmaker on the wing as well with three assists per game … Playmaking background as he was named the best passer in the Atlanta area in 2019 and grew up as a point guard due to a late growth spurt … Quick trigger and high release allow him to get shots up without much space on the perimeter … Aggressive slasher who showed he can initiate contact and get to the line with over four attempts per game … More than just a floor-spacing shooter with his handles and finishing inside the arc … Disruptive and agile defender who can switch 1-3 on the perimeter and even onto smaller 4’s to contest outside jumpers … Averaged nearly a steal and a half per game … Extremely intelligent player who reads defenses well with precise passing and timely cuts to get open looks for himself … Positive AST/TO ratio as a three-year starter with Belmont … Showed a selfless understanding of his role at the combine, shifting from go-to scorer at Belmont to exceptional role player alongside the talented teammates around him … Great positional size … Positive rebounder with over five per game in his final season … Stays out of foul trouble …
Weaknesses:
Not the most explosive athlete with just a 35.5-inch max vertical. He’s also more quick than fast, often creating space for himself with shiftiness rather than straight-line speed … Faced low-level competition collegiality, compared to his draft competition, although he did show he belongs with that competition in the combine scrimmages … Taking these performances for what they were, just two scrimmages, and balancing that with four years of tape is the biggest challenge for evaluators … Turns 22 on July 16th, limiting his upside … Doesn’t have elite potential, but should be able to contribute as a role player if his efficiency carries over to the next level … Measurements, particularly wingspan, were slightly disappointing, but Sheppard plays much longer and taller than these measurements suggest … While his three point shot showed steady improvement throughout his college career, climbing to 40% as a senior, his FT percentage flat lined and hovered around and below 70% throughout four years at Belmont … Lack of efficiency from FT line clouds confidence in his ability to become a floor spacer/outside threat at next level …
Notes:
Measured 6′ 5.25” barefoot, 8′ 4” standing reach, 194.6 lbs and a 6′ 7.75” wingspan and a 29.5 inch standing vertical and a 35.5′ inch max vertical at the 2023 NBA Draft Combine …Four-year career including three as the starter at Belmont … First Team All-Conference from 2022-2023 and First Team All-Defense in 2023 … Averaged 17.5 points in two scrimmages at the 2023 NBA Draft Combine as one of the top standouts from the event … Scored a career-high 41 points vs. Tennessee Tech as a junior …
Derek Bast 6/15/23  Every NBA team is looking for plus-sized wings such as Sheppard who can do a little more than just shoot. Sheppard appears to have helped himself in the pre-draft process, starting at the NBA combine where he showed his gaudy production in the Missouri Valley translated against better competition, and then continuing in private workouts, where he shot the ball extremely well after making 41% of his 3-pointers this past season. -- Jonathan Givony
 Sheppard feels like a real sleeper in this class, being a jumbo guard with shooting touch and the length to defend at a high level. He has a good feel for the game given he has played point guard in the past, so he has lead guard skills but is more of an NBA off-ball guard or wing with his size. Sheppard will turn 22 shortly after the draft after averaging nearly 19 points per game for Belmont last season.
He’s a great 3-point shooter, as his percentages from beyond the arc increased every single season. He converted on 41.5% of his six triples per game last season. One of the reasons he’s so effective from deep is his ability to move off the ball to put himself in the right position. He relocates well and his teammates find him for good looks.
Although his height is an advantage, Sheppard is thin which does affect him some when playing against physical defenders or looking to get in the paint. He also has work to do as a free throw shooter. If he’s going to thrive at the next level, he will need to get better at putting the ball on the floor and creating for himself.

Sheppard is an underrated passer, producing nearly three assists per game as a senior. The same goes for his defense, which still has work to do but is solid. He generated 1.4 steals per game and has the frame to defend multiple positions. He earned All-MVC Defensive Team honors as a senior and can defend both guards and wings. However, there were some matchups last season in which Sheppard looked a bit overwhelmed.
Thanks to his combination of size (6-foot-6), length, shooting and defensive playmaking, Sheppard is someone NBA teams will be looking to fill a 3-and-D role. Within that role, Sheppard provides additional value as an overall dribble-pass-shoot wing, a skillset all NBA wings really need. He doesn’t get as much attention as others in this draft due to where he played, but he absolutely has NBA upside. He was one of the top mid-major players in the country last season. The fact that he was invited to the NBA Draft Combine proves that."
Nick Smith,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Jamal Crawford
Strengths:
Smith Jr is a 6’5 185 lb combo guard prospect with very good length and nice athleticism for the NBA level … Really quick and speedy, and has the frame to add muscle … Likes to score the ball (12.5 ppg as a Fr.) and is pretty aggressive doing so, especially when it comes to slashing or hitting shots off the dribble … Can put up points in chunks at his best (5 20 point games in 17 games played) and is widely viewed as a ‘microwave’ scoring threat … Won’t have many problems breaking down the defense; has a combination of good ball-handling ability and a quick 1st step that gives him intriguing potential as a shot creator … Comfortable in the mid-range; can pressure defenders with his ability to stop on a dime and stick pull-up jumpers … Makes good use of runners and floaters in the lane as well … Occasionally makes some flashy lay-ins at the rim with his craftiness and touch … Not afraid to shoot from long range either, and showed some flashes from distance this season (1.4 made 3s game on over 4 attempts) … Can play on or off the ball and generally did a nice job of being active as a cutter or looking for ways to get open for shots when he was on the wing … Has all the tools to be an effective defender in the backcourt, and played with good energy in a demanding defensive system at Arkansas … Has strong on-ball defensive potential, but also has enough quickness and length to deflect passes and become more of a threat as a ball thief … Would fit well in an up-tempo offensive system with his speed and aggressive approach; has good projections as a open court player …
Weaknesses:
Not very physical and a bit light in the britches at the moment; needs to add more muscle to his frame … Can get steamrolled on the ball as a defender more than you’d like to see and really struggled as a finisher offensively (39.6 FG% inside the arc) … Shot selection needs improvement (37.6 FG%); often takes low percentage shots in the mid-range area when he would be better served moving the ball or attacking the rim … Pretty inconsistent 3-point shooter (33.8 3FG%), doesn’t handle contests that well right now and will often change his release with a hand in his face … Listed as a combo guard, but isn’t a natural playmaker for others (1.7 apg) … When he’s on ball he mostly only passes as a last resort after the defense collapses on him … Middling feel for the game and basketball IQ at this stage, will force action and try to make plays that aren’t there … Doesn’t have much impact on games outside of scoring; can be hard to justify playing him when his shots aren’t falling … Won’t contribute much on the glass and is a poor rebounder even for a backcourt player (1.6 rpg) … Pressed on but never quite gained his rhythm after missing a critical chunk of the season dealing with a knee injury …
Overall:
Nick Smith Jr was a ballyhooed prospect out of HS and was ranked as high as the #1 recruit in the 2022 Class, and was a main reason Arkansas was considered a preseason national title favorite with their highly regarded recruiting class … Injuries took their toll on Smith Jr and Arkansas as a whole, as he missed about 2 months of action dealing with a knee injury and Arkansas struggled a bit during the SEC schedule without him but eventually made it to the Sweet 16 … He showed the shot-making ability, burst and handle that made him a projected top 10 pick before the season in his 17 games played, as well as some potential on the defensive end given his length, intensity and quickness … There is something to be said about his potential as an instant offense threat … He wasn’t very efficient, needs to get stronger and more physical getting all the way to the bucket (which ties in with his ability to improve his efficiency) as well as being more productive outside of his scoring, but he had a limited sample size and could benefit from having more continuity and rhythm if his knee problems are behind him … He may have some naysayers in the top half of the draft but his potential is too great for him to not hear his name sooner than later in the 1st round of the 2023 Draft …
Jorrye Nixon 4/17/23
Strengths:
6’5 combo guard … Good size, length, and versatility for position. Can play on or off the ball … Hits shots off the dribble and just needs a little bit of space to get shot off. Quick release. Very dangerous midrange scorer with a very effective floater … Averaged 17.6 points per game on 49.2% FG% over the Nike EYBL in 2021 … Good ball-handler, creates offense, and gets where he wants with his dribble, using either hand. Changes speed well with the ball and operates well in traffic. Stays under control when picking up speed … Sees the floor well, alert, and good passing ability. Knows his cross-court options as a passer. Good touch on lob passes … Defends well on and off the ball. Sits and consistently hounds the ball-handler. Fights over screens …
Weaknesses:
Slight frame and can get stronger. Finishing at the rim at higher levels may be an obstacle … Good athlete and smooth but isn’t overly explosive … Although he shoots well from midrange and shot a respectable 37.5% 3PT% on 4.8 3PT attempts per game over the Nike EYBL, he can improve 3PT shooting consistency … Can be too content for midrange shots/floaters rather than getting to the rim … Although rebounding isn’t a heavy role for a guard, he doesn’t stand out in that area and his 3.5 rebounds per game over the Nike EYBL in 2021 is below other guards of his caliber. Has the tools and gifts to improve in that area …
Outlook:
Incoming Arkansas freshman … 2022 McDonald’s All-American … MVP of the 2022 Jordan Brand Classic with 27 points (7-15 FG, 5-7 3PT, 8-8 FT) … Scored 10 points in the 2022 Nike Hoop Summit … 2022 Naismith High School Player of the Year Finalist …
Evan Tomes 7/16/22  An uneven season came to a disappointing end for Smith and Arkansas in the Sweet 16 with a blowout loss to UConn. Smith started the game hot but cooled, finishing his NCAA tournament shooting 6-for-23 in three games with two rebounds and an assist.

Smith never looked like himself relative to what we saw at the high school level and in his spectacular run to the Nike EYBL championship game (alongside Miller) in the summer 2021, which propelled him into consideration as the No. 1 prospect in his recruiting class. Multiple executives told ESPN they consider Smith the best NBA prospect in his class after the McDonald's and Jordan Brand Classic practices, scrimmages and JBC game, where he scored 24 points in 21 minutes.

NBA teams will want to learn more about the knee injuries Smith suffered in early November, which caused him to play just five games through mid-February. He's never been the most explosive driver or powerful finisher, even before his injuries, but shooting under 40% inside the arc was a surprising outcome this season after converting nearly 60% of his 2-pointers and living at the free throw line in previous settings.

Smith has always been at his best with the ball in his hands. His ability to change speeds, polished footwork, live-dribble passing, creative finishing and off-the-dribble shot-making shine through. Playing on a team with several teammates who are similarly ball-dominant in Black, Devo Davis and Ricky Council and not having the chance to grow through the season with his decision-making likely played a role in Smith's struggles.

He was usually relegated to standing in the corner and looked sped up when he was called upon to create in Arkansas' dysfunctional and poorly spaced offense, often settling for difficult floaters and pull-ups from outside the paint. Still only 18 years old, Smith has time to work on his frame and better channel his frenetic energy as he's nearly 18 months younger than his former teammate Miller.

Smith has looked frustrated with his struggles both on and off the floor in recent weeks, telling reporters ""people don't know I've been through so much stuff this year,"" after Arkansas advanced in the Sweet 16, while having some emotional outbursts on the bench.

Most players in Smith's position would not have even been playing, as it was widely assumed among NBA teams that he would likely shut down his season and fully heal his injury once he was removed from the lineup for a second time. His decision to return might cost him on draft night, but it will be appreciated by some teams because of what it says about his character.

Getting back to 100% for private team workouts should help Smith show a different side of his game.-- Jonathan Givony  One of the most anticipated college freshman in the country this season was Smith. While he didn't produce at the level many had hoped, mostly due to injuries, the upside is undeniable. 
At 6-foot-5, he has solid size for a combo guard, but it’s the nearly 6-foot-9 wingspan that makes him special from a physical standpoint. A spectacular scorer, Smith boasts a quick first step and is overall shifty with the ball. His dribble moves are crisp and intentional, and he’s efficient with every movement he makes with the ball in his hands.
What makes Smith so lethal on the offensive end is his jump shot. He’s got pure form and mechanics that make his shots look effortless. He’s also got great range for his age and has no problem knocking down deep triples.
In the midrange, Smith is crafty and effective with pull-up jumpers as well as a variety of floaters. With that in mind, he’s not the greatest finisher at the rim and often tends to avoid taking it to the cup. Instead, he settles for jumpers which by nature are lower percentage looks. If Smith is going to put together a complete offensive game, that’s one aspect he can improve upon. That should naturally come with him getting stronger and becoming better at absorbing contact.
Strength also comes into play on defense, where Smith certainly has upside but hasn’t emerged as an elite defender. Like many young prospects, his ability to put on weight and get stronger will determine his overall ceiling on both ends.
The combo guard is more of a scorer than distributor at this point, but definitely has shown the ability to set teammates up. He only produced 29 assists this season, while also turning the ball over 27 times. When Smith’s shot isn’t falling at the college level, he will need to find ways to still impact the game.
Although he was just a freshman this season, Smith is a natural leader and is typically the alpha when he steps on the court. Combine that with the tremendous amount of skill that he has and it’s no surprise that he could will likely be a lottery pick in the 2023 NBA Draft despite the underwhelming season. 
He played in just 17 games this season as his knee continuously gave him issues. His health will certainly be something NBA teams consider in the pre-draft process during his workouts and interviews. Smith could end up being a guy that falls more than he should and ends up being a steal at where he's taken.
Smith played his senior year of high school at at North Little Rock High School, where led the team to a 27-3 record and an Arkansas Class 6A championship. During that senior campaign, he absolutely filled up the stat sheet and often flirted with a triple-double. He played alongside another incredible talent in this recent freshman class in Kel'el Ware, who had a solid season at Oregon but will be transferring before taking a shot at the 2024 NBA Draft. To cap off his high school campaign Smith won MVP of the 2022 Jordan Brand Classic, where he showcased his offensive skillset against the top talent in the country."

Sensabaugh is a burly SF/PF at around 6’5 230, with a build resembling that of an NFL tight end … Also a solid athlete for his dimensions; shows good burst, body control and explosiveness … An offensive machine with mismatch scoring tools; has real 3-level scoring ability and can do damage in a variety of ways (16.3 PPG as a Fr.) … Soft touch shows up all in his 3-point shooting (40 3FG% on 4.5 3FGA/G), mid-range game, finishing around the rim, and as a post-up player (52 FG% inside the arc, 48 FG% overall) … Fluid release and shoots with confidence, making him a factor hitting shots when left open or against closeouts when spotting up … Strong first step and frame allow him to steamroll defenders on his slashes to the rim, particularly when operating on the perimeter against wings … Has a wide, sturdy base to power through contact; built for physical play and picked up a number of ‘and-1s’ this past season (83 FT% on 3 FTA/G) … Will occasionally flash some juice as a leaper and finish above the rim when he has momentum … Can seal in the low and mid post areas & has a good feel for using his shoulders to create space for his fadeaway & turnaround jumper … Outstanding production in the 15-18 ft area; is a threat facing up on short kickouts, screens or pulling up off 1 or 2 dribbles and sticking shots when chased off the line … Adequate ball-handling ability with both hands to create space & will use simple crossovers and stepbacks when overplayed … Makes sound reads and knows how to find open spots on the court, making him a promising off-ball scorer who won’t always have to create his own shots … A relative late bloomer who could just be scratching the surface after shooting up the HS rankings as a Sr. and enjoying a better than expected Fr. season; wasn’t on any 2023 draft boards prior to the season … Has a clear niche and that gives him a somewhat high floor as a prospect …
Weaknesses:
Unconventional physical tools with average height and length by NBA standards despite his wider frame, and is more powerful than athletic … Not especially quick or light on his feet, and his leaping ability & speed while not poor are that of a “build-up” variety … More of a below the rim player, particularly in the halfcourt … Physical nature and strength can be used against him at times, leading to his picking up charges against more savvy defenders…Defense is a work in progress currently; poor fundamentals and overall awareness at times landed him in the doghouse at Ohio State despite his offensive prowess … There are some legitimate questions about what positions he projects to consistently defend at the NBA level … Was often directly targeted by opponents at the point of attack but also seemed to be a step behind off the ball when it came to locating shooters and making controlled closeouts, which led to plenty of possessions with team defensive collapses and easy shot attempts … Doesn’t force many turnovers or disrupt passing lanes (0.5 SPG)…Fared slightly better defending post-ups and frontcourt players, but still gets shot over easily due to his lack of height, length and static leaping skills (0.4 BPG)…Average overall rebounding skills (5.4 RPG) and won’t grab many boards outside of his general area…Doesn’t pass the ball much; mostly wired to get his own shots and displayed a bit of tunnel vision (1.2 APG)…Should monitor his conditioning and diet closely (only played 24 MPG), as he has a body type that could easily struggle with injuries or weight issues in the future if he’s not careful
Overall:
Brice Sensabaugh was a consensus 4-star prospect out of the Orlando area coming out of HS, where he won Florida’s Mr Basketball award as a Sr…In the summer leading into Sensabaugh’s Fr. season, Ohio State coach Chris Holtmann told anybody who would listen that Sensabaugh, the last signee in the Buckeyes’ top 10 ranked 2022 HS class, would be an impact player due to his vast offensive repertoire and he wasn’t wrong … He ended up leading the team in scoring while being one of the most prolific “per-minute” scorers in the country, showing the ability to hit from 3, mid-range and in the post at a high level…His combination of brawn, touch, confidence and mismatch ability are the main reason why he’s seen as one of the best pure scorers in the 2023 Draft Class … He is a bit one-dimensional in that he doesn’t have much impact elsewhere though, and he especially has a ton of work to do on the defensive end of the floor, where he was often so much of a liability that he was unplayable for significant spurts throughout the year for a disappointing OSU team … He also should be mindful of the attrition that comes with an 82 game season, as Sensabaugh is thickly built and will need to focus on staying in shape to get the most out of himself…Still, his scoring and strength are intriguing & if he can round out the rest of his game he will have a solid chance of realizing his full potential … Sensabaugh has a draft range that could be anywhere from late lottery to the early 2nd round, with most mocks having him firmly in the 1st round currently …
Jorrye Nixon 5/29/23  At 5-15 in Big Ten play, Ohio State is in the midst of its worst season in 25 years. That's something NBA scouts will certainly weigh when evaluating the gaudy scoring production of super freshman Sensabaugh, who has hit a wall over the past 10 games from an efficiency standpoint, shooting 30% for 3 and 50% inside the arc.  Even with Sensabaugh's recent struggles, he's still the second-most-prolific per-minute scorer in college basketball among projected draft picks, trailing only runaway National Player of the Year favorite Zach Edey. Sensabaugh has a clear case to be considered the best perimeter shooter in this draft in terms of volume and accuracy (42% 3P%) and is far from being just a shooter, also showing quite a bit of potential in the pick-and-roll, when creating one-on-one and as a post-scorer; he's capable of putting the ball in the basket from anywhere on the floor.  The biggest questions revolve around his defense, where he's stuck between positions as a 6-6 power forward with average length, a husky frame and inconsistent intensity and awareness that causes him to be frequently targeted and scored on by opponents.  As the No. 13 seed in the loaded Big Ten tournament, just advancing another day or two would be considered a major success for the Buckeyes, something Sensabaugh will play a large role in on both ends of the floor. How much progress Sensabaugh can make with his body during the pre-draft process (assuming he elects to enter the draft) will be even more crucial, as NBA teams want to see him get in much better shape to take him as seriously as his outstanding scoring production suggests they should. -- Jonathan Givony
 Although he wasn’t on the radar as a potential first-round pick entering his freshman season, Sensabaugh has been fantastic and better than expected, which has catapulted him into the mid-first conversation.
With great size at 6-foot-6, he can play as an off-ball guard or on the wing. That versatility and size translate on both ends, which should be attractive to NBA teams.
Not only does Sensabaugh have the height, but he’s also built like a professional and is extremely strong.
A three-level scorer, the freshman is a walking bucket that was a catalyst for the Buckeyes’ offense all season. His jumper is smooth and one of the better looking strokes in the country. His range is deep, which should translate at the next level.
Although he’s a natural scorer that can create for himself, he needs to improve as a facilitator. Sensabaugh won’t be asked to be a lead guard at the NBA level, but does sometimes have poor shot selection and gets tunnel vision.
Regardless, his build and versatility give him upside as a solid two-way player at the next level. He has ideal positional size to make an impact in the NBA, and is young enough that he’s absolutely just scratching the surface of his potential.
Sensabaugh also isn’t scared of the big moments, as he is a legitimate shot maker in the clutch. That’s something that can’t be taught, which will be attractive to NBA teams.
With a good pre-draft process, there’s a real chance Sensabaugh goes just outside the lottery. An advanced shot maker with a physical frame, he has all of the tools to be an impactful selection that contributes early on as a rookie.
The former Gatorade Player of the Year in Florida was one of the big surprises of this college season. He of course had talent coming in, but wasn’t expected to be this good so early. Similar to Ohio State guards of the past, Sensabaugh was one of the biggest risers of this class relative to pre-season expectations where he was pinned as someone that could need multiple college seasons to make the jump."

NBA Comparison: Doug Christie
Strengths:
3-and-D wing with a quick release and efficient scoring from beyond the arc … Flourished at Gonzaga in his 3-year career as a terrific floor spacer who attacks closeouts and finishes in the lane with a tremendous floater … Can also attack the rim on aggressive closeouts with excellent touch in and around the paint. Incredibly efficient inside the arc during his first two seasons at 70 and 66 percent before a dip to 52 percent as a junior … One of the best rebounding wings in the nation with six rebounds per game last season … Perfectly blended into Gonzaga’s fast-paced offense with his speed and intelligence to find his spot in transition … Can score in both spot-ups and off the dribble in isolation from beyond the arc … Excellent movement off the ball, especially running defenders off screens … Clutch performer. Showed a willingness and confidence to take the last shot in big moments, with a pair of clutch game-winning shots against BYU and UCLA, which came in the Sweet 16 … Won’t have an issue adjusting to NBA range with many of his 3-pointers coming from well beyond the arc … Great form and shooting mechanics on his jumper … Has added a solid floater to get baskets on drives … Excellent touch and body control around the rim to convert … His constant movement, quick changes of speed and long strides allow him to get to the basket without beating his man on his first step … Used timely backdoor cuts in Gonzaga’s motion offense to create easy looks for himself … Disciplined defender who has the length to block shots at a solid rate … Began to take over the role of Gonzaga’s go to player late in his junior season … Raised free throw percentage to near 80% as a junior … COnverted a solid number of ally oops …
Weaknesses:
Unorthodox release on his shot … Awkward base to his jump shot with his knees tucked inside more than his toes … Toughness received some criticism through his three year career … Not an explosive athlete as he relies more on lengthy strides and a relentless motor to win toward the basket … Doesn’t do much in the playmaking or shot creating departments in slower half-court sets. His assists rarely came off the dribble … Only an average free-throw shooter for a shooting wing at 74% for his career … His inability to consistently win off the dribble is supported by his low number of free throw attempts per game (3.1 attempts in 29 minutes per game over the last two seasons) … A lot of his worst games came against high-level opponents who were able to put high-level athletes on him. Due to his lack of top-notch athleticism, a lot of his success may be system-based if he is able to get out and run consistently … Slower paced teams may struggle to get him going outside of a floor-spacing/shooting role …
Notes:
Measured 6’6.00” barefoot, 8’9.00” standing reach, 208.8 lbs, 6’9.25” wingspan and a 34.5 inch max vertical at 2023 NBA Draft Combine … 2022-23 l-WCC First Team … 2023 NCAA Tournament All-West Region … Averaged 31 points and 11 rebounds as a senior at Liberty High School in Las Vegas … McDonald’s All-American Game participant … Played on Nike EYBL AAU circuit in 2018 and 2019 FIBA U-19 World Cup in Greece … Native of Las Vegas, NV … Put up a career high 40 points against Portland in his junior season …
Derek Bast 6/10/23  Although Strawther will be entering the 2023 NBA Draft after three college seasons, his age shouldn’t turn teams away. He entered the 2022 NBA Draft but opted to bet on himself and spend one more season at Gonzaga.
He’s built like a wing, but can also play the off-ball guard spot which opens up his versatility on both ends.
Strawther improved as a 3-point shooter in every college season, eclipsing 40% from deep as a junior. His shot is somewhat unorthodox, but that doesn’t worry us long-term. He gets good elevation on his jumper which will help moving forward. His free throw shooting is also improving which can often be an indicator of future shooting success.
The 6-foot-7 prospect was once again thrown into a much larger role last year, but thrived with the new opportunity. He was a great positional rebounder, even on a team with dominant bigs.
What’s promising about Strawther is his understanding of roles. Although he came to Gonzaga as a big recruit, he doesn’t try to do too much. He takes generally takes good shots within the flow of the offense, which is a huge reason he is so efficient. He doesn’t force shots near the rim, allowing the offense to come to him.
As a defender, Strawther has a ton of quickness and covers a lot of ground. He’s active on that end of the floor and should have no problem being an effective defender at the NBA level.
Gonzaga is a fantastic system that produces NBA talent nearly every season. As he's been able to emerge as a cornerstone of the team alongside Drew Timme, Strawther has earned some late first-round buzz.
He represents Puerto Rico at the international level, which has been another chance for him to showcase his skills."
Kobe Brown,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Damien Wilkins
Strengths:
The “brown mamba” is a physical playmaking wing who can stretch the floor and create for others in half-court offense … Could make an argument that he is the best passing wing in the 2023 NBA Draft class with his vision and quick processing in transition and off the dribble … Uses his physical frame to finish through contact with efficiency around the rim. Can also contort his body with surprising acrobatics in the air to avoid contact if there is space near the hoop … Deceptive quickness with his first step to create an advantage on drives. Often makes the right decision when he wins off the bounce, either creating open looks for others or taking it all the way in for a bucket … Catch-and-shoot specialist, which will likely be much of his role early on in the NBA. But he is versatile enough on the offensive end to expand his role into a secondary ball-handler/shot creator in mismatches … Can create these mismatches with outstanding strength that could allow him to handle powerful big men in the post … Smooth ball-handler with a decent bag. Protects the ball extraordinarily well when he picks it up toward the basket … Can win in face-ups or with his back turned toward the basket … Above average post scorer from the wing … Uses the rim well to protect him on reverse layups and dunks … Aggressive rebounder who put up solid numbers all four years with Missouri (6.0 per game for career) … Developed into a terrific 3-point shooter, both on the move and in spot-ups as a senior (45.5%) … Growth as a free-throw shooter supported his growth as a 3-point shooter (79% FT in final two seasons) … Overcame a turnover problem as a junior (2.3 per game) and cut it down to 1.6 per game while growing more confident and courageous in his passing abilities … Also cut down on fouls per game (3.1 to 2.5) … Intelligent player who continuously developed, showing a strong work ethic and coachability … Makes up for lack of quickness with intelligent defending and excellent timing when going for strips and blocks. Averaged a steal and a half per game last season. Long arms helped his aggressive nature as an off-ball defender out on the perimeter, deflecting and intercepting passes that he otherwise wouldn’t be able to reach … Quick and fluid shooting stroke
Weaknesses:
Not the quickest lateral athlete or most explosive vertical athlete, as illustrated by his 32” max vertical leap at the combine … While his free-throw shooting as a junior backed up his growth from the perimeter, such a dramatic jump from 20.6% to 45.5% (from 3) raises concerns about Brown’s true shooting potential and if he will succeed from NBA range at a consistent rate … Had some bad misses throughout his career that could be red flags … Classic in-between positions player. Could be too slow to play the four and too short to play as a small-ball five, especially without much to show in the rim protection department … If he can’t bully his way to the basket or win off the dribble, his mid-range game lacks any confidence and often leads to thrown up shots or turnovers at the second level. Mostly a 3-point shooter or finisher around the rim without the second level scoring to his game … Will struggle in perimeter defending without great foot speed and quickness. Won’t be a defensive liability though, with his instincts and intelligence on that end of the floor …
Notes:
Measured 6’6.5” barefoot, 8’10.5” standing reach, 252.2 lbs and a 7’0.75” wingspan and a 28.5” standing vertical and a 32” max vertical at the 2023 NBA Combine … 2022-23 SEC Scholar-Athlete of the Year … 2023 All-SEC First Team and 2022 All-SEC Second Team … National Player of the Week on Dec. 26, 2022 … Four-year starter at Missouri … Led team is scoring and rebounding in each of last two seasons …
Derek Bast 6/21/23  Brown emerged as one of the most skilled and productive big men in college as a 23-year-old senior, surprisingly leading Missouri to a No. 7 seed in the NCAA tournament. Brown doesn't look like a high-level NBA prospect at first glance, being undersized and needing to improve his frame. His skill level very much suits the modern NBA, though, as a 45% 3-point shooter who initiates quite a bit of offense for Missouri pushing off the defensive glass and operating in the mid and high post thanks to his strong feel for the game.

He is a good ball handler, deft passer and dynamic shot-maker in addition to being a real mismatch with his strength, skill and versatility, having guard skills despite playing mostly at center with his powerful frame. Brown's defense will be heavily scrutinized by NBA teams, as he doesn't have great length for a 5, doesn't cover ground very well on an island to guard better 4s and is just an average rebounder. NBA teams will want to get a better feel for Brown during the pre-draft process, and continuing to build momentum in the NCAA tournament certainly wouldn't hurt his draft stock.-- Jonathan Givony  Although he’s an older prospect entering this draft cycle, the experience and versatility Brown brings to the table is impressive. He’s played every single position at the college level effectively and has essentially been a starter since he stepped on campus over four years ago.
Part of his breakout senior season was a function of improved perimeter shooting. While he shot below 30% in each of his first three seasons at Missouri, he knocked down over 45% of his 3-point attempts in the most recent season. With that in mind, there has to be some consideration on whether he truly improved that much or if it was a small sample size of inflated numbers. NBA teams will have to determine if they buy stock in Brown’s perimeter jumper.
Even without the perimeter scoring upside, Brown does much more on offense. For starters, he’s extremely strong with his 250 pound frame that he likes to leverage against smaller defenders. He’s able to back down guards to generate good looks closer to the rim.
Furthermore, Brown has a unique skillset for a combo forward. Given he played point guard in high school, he has facilitation and passing skills that are rare for a prospect of his size. While he doesn’t play lead guard full time, he’s certainly capable of ensuring an offense runs smoothly and he surveys the floor well. He isn’t an offensive hub but can be a catalyst of success on that end even when he’s not scoring himself.
Brown has no problem pulling down a defensive rebound and pushing the break. This is where the point forward upside shines as a versatile prospect. He’s also great at things teams need from frontcourt players, like rebounding and interior defense. The Tiger isn’t an elite defender or athlete, but can hold his own against a variety of positions.
Overall, Brown plays with a ton of energy. He makes plays that others wouldn’t simply due to effort and IQ which results in him often being in the right spot.
The question for him will be around fit at the next level. While it’s great that he can play any position at the college level, that will change in the NBA. He’ll likely lack the quickness to be effective on both ends against guards, but also be too small to play in some frontcourt situations. Some prospects similar to Brown in the past have ended up being extremely valuable players, while others ended up being tweeners that can’t find a fit at the next level. It could come down to the right team and system for Brown to make it work in the NBA.
Regardless, the former four-star just plays smart, which is why he’s continued to emerge as an NBA talent over the past few months."

NBA Comparison: Udoka Azubuike/Ian Mahinmi
Strengths:
Athletic, mobile center … Very good size for a big … Has amazing length (reports suggest wingspan between 7’5 and 7’7 feet) … Bouncy, a very good leaper either off two feet or one foot … Already has an NBA body … Built like a tank, it’s really difficult even for physically imposing bigs to move him … Understands his role and limitations, doesn’t try to do too much … Coachable, will always do what his coach asks him to do… Has a translatable game to the next level … Likes to play physically, doesn’t back down to anyone … Runs the floor very well for a big… A great, strong finisher at the rim … Wants to dunk everything … Sets good, strong screens either on or off the ball … He doesn’t have a problem setting screens constantly during the same play… Good at setting picks in pick and rolls, has nice mobility in his hips … The definition of a rim runner… Very good in pick and roll actions, with dynamic dives to the basket … Occasionally slips in Pick and Roll to have a running start, catching his opponents off guard … A point guard’s ideal partner in Pick and Roll actions when it comes to lobs, he jumps high enough to grab almost any pass … Can absorb contact well when finishing at the rim… Moves well without the ball … He is effective when standing in the dunking spot to receive a pass … Great offensive rebounder, crashes the boards and adds pressure to his opponent … Makes his presence felt on defense … A good post up defender, knows how to use his body and length … A good rim protector due to size and athleticism, tries to contest every shot … Has shown promise when defending in flat or drop coverage in Pick and Roll actions … Has good enough mobility and lateral quickness to support switch defense to some degree …
Weaknesses:
Has average feel for the game … Game is still pretty raw and depends mostly on his instincts … Being a part of an established club had it’s consequences, since he had limited playing time for years … There is a concern that his limited playing time slowed down his development … Limited skillset offensively… Depends on his teammates to be effective on offense … His post up game needs a lot of work, it is kind of mechanical for now, with just a jump hook … He should add some counter moves, or any moves to that matter when Posting Up … He needs to improve finishing plays with his left (weak) hand … Has no shooting range, does all his damage in the paint … Shooting mechanics need work … A bad free throw shooter can be a target in games … He is kind of hit or miss when he does a short roll in Pick and Rolls, he can either dribble once and score, travel or make a bad pass … Playmaking isn’t there yet… Foul prone, he has the tendency to make an occasional “bad” foul due to his lack of experience and reps … It remains a question mark how he will react when he is matched athletically and physically against more polished bigs … Average defensive rebounder, depends too much on his physical tools and at times forgets to box out … Not always focused on defense when defending off the ball … Chasing for blocks leads to offensive rebound opportunities for his opponents … Has problems when he is asked to defend Pick and Rolls doing Hedge Out or Blitz, he occasionally turns his back to the ball and leaves his man open …
Outlook:
James Nnaji is a beast … A great athlete and leaper, who is already a real threat in Pick and Roll actions and really active on the glass, while he makes his presence felt on defense … The fact that he already has a defined role is a two-way street though … He could either fit perfectly from the start, or make a team worry that he has already hit a plateau since he has a lot to work on his game in every other aspect of his game … He is pretty raw and lacks reps on a high level, but at the same time he has shown flashes on both ends of the floor and especially on the defensive end … His upside is a question mark, but he has enough tools to be considered a player with the potential to become a good role player …
Stefanos Makris 6/7/23  Playing for Barcelona, currently in first place in the Spanish ACB and third in the EuroLeague, minutes haven't been easy to come by for 18-year-old Nnaji in his team's stacked frontcourt rotation.  Two recent starting nods in domestic league play have allowed NBA scouts to get a deeper look at the chiseled 6-11 Nigerian with a 7-4 wingspan, and he responded by posting 32 points and eight rebounds in 43 minutes of action on near-perfect 13-for-14 shooting, leaving one to wonder how productive he would be in a situation with more consistent playing time. Nnaji's virtues are readily obvious at first glance, as he's one of the most physically gifted prospects in this draft class, blessed with incredible quickness getting off his feet for dunks and blocks, and outstanding mobility running the floor and covering ground defensively. He draws quite a few fouls with his enviable combination of speed, power and explosiveness, putting pressure on opposing defenses every time he rolls to the basket and offering a significant vertical spacing target with his improving hands and huge catch radius.  Nnaji is also making subtle improvement as the season continues with his passing and ability to take slower defenders off the dribble in a straight line with huge strides, things that are very much a work in progress due to his average skill level but are still encouraging to see considering his lack of experience.  Nnaji only started playing basketball in July 2016 and moved to Ratgeber Basketball Academy in Hungary off a Facebook post he made following the Giants of Africa camp in 2018. He spent two years in Hungary before moving to Barcelona in August 2020, progressing through the ranks of their junior teams and the Spanish fifth division to carve out the role he has now.  Nnaji's processing speed and awareness on both ends of the floor are still a work in progress, but the fact that he can make the impact he does on both ends of the floor mostly off his tools gives him plenty of upside to grow into as the game slows down for him. With his minutes likely to be inconsistent for the remainder of the season and Barcelona's schedule through the month of June likely preventing him from conducting private workouts with NBA teams, getting a firm handle on Nnaji's draft stock won't be easy, but he's done well to solidify his candidacy as a first-round prospect with the opportunities he's received thus far. -- Jonathan Givony
 If there’s a big man that an NBA team wants to draft next summer who would be an interesting project, it’s Nnaji. He’s quite raw as a prospect today, given he didn’t start playing basketball until 2016, but could end up being a value pick in the 2023 NBA Draft.
The Nigerian big is extremely young and will still be 18 years old on the night of the upcoming draft and is one of the youngest prospects in this class. Nnaji has the ability to play the forward or center spot with his unique physical tools. There’s no question his body is ready for the NBA today.
A rising star in the EuroLeague, Nnaji does have great tools, but his skills need a lot of refinement. He’s not effective outside of the paint on the offensive end, which could limit him at the next level. At this point, he’s not at all a deep threat, nor his he a good free throw shooter.
It will take quite a bit of time to develop a jumper, so perhaps Nnaji should start expending his range into the midrange before beginning to shoot beyond the arc.
Again, most of the shots the 6-foot-10 big takes are near the rim. He’s ultra efficient, converting on over 75% of his field goal attempts. Whether it’s finishing with power or touch, Nnaji can use both hands.
He’s got a great base and solid footwork that allows him to generate good looks in the paint. Regardless, Nnaji doesn’t project to be the focal point of a team’s offense whatsoever.
Nnaji has a high motor and is strong for his age, so he naturally finds himself in the right place on both ends of the floor. He’s a great rim runner and has good acceleration for a player of his size. He is also a good rebounder, but we think he could certainly improve on that front and pull down more boards.

On the defensive end, Nnaji’s energy is contagious. He can hold his own against strong bigs, but also moves well laterally. We wouldn’t consider him a good perimeter defender on guards, but he’s at least not a liability when switched onto a smaller player. Regardless of who he’s defending, the Nigerian big is a good shot blocker.
With that in mind, he’s still raw on that end of the floor as well and is a bit prone to fouling opponents.
Nnaji’s defensive upside is definitely higher than offense at this point, but he’s raw so anything could happen. He doesn’t project to be a star at the NBA level, but could be a key complimentary piece in the right role. While he showed some impressive flashes over the past year, he's far from a lock to be a high draft pick this summer. However, the upside is clearly there and teams will give him a real look in the first round especially given his age."

NBA Comparison: Jeremy Pargo/Shelvin Mack
Strengths:
A mature and crafty point guard with tremendous strength … Loves to play a physical brand of basketball … Surprising post skills and shot creation with his back turned to the basket … Excellent efficiency and court vision from the low block allowed him to dissect opposing defenses with post scoring and timely passes out of double teams to create open looks for shooters on the perimeter … Crafty ball-handler who can keep his dribble going until a decision needs to be made … This helped prevent turnovers (2.3 TO) despite his high usage (27.3%) and assist rate (39.2%) for the Nittany Lions … Keeping his dribble so long also helped him obtain excellent position in the low post by continuously forcing his defender under the basket … Physical driver who isn’t afraid to draw contact and get to the line. His free throw attempts per game do not do justice to his willingness to create contact and finish through it at the rim … Covers a lot of ground with his step back jumper, allowing him to get his shot up from the mid-range or 3-point arc over lengthier defenders … Converted many of these fallaway jumpers on his way to a 17.7 point average in his final season in Happy Valley … High-level patience with the ball in his hand … Gritty player who scraps for rebounds (7.4 per game) and elevates the play of his teammates with his tenacity and leadership … Capable of a triple-double on any night in college with his well-rounded play. Can impact the game in many ways even when his shot isn’t falling … Productive in all five years of his college career, averaging no less than 12.9 points per game … Utilizes a deceptive shot-fake at all three levels to get out of tight quarters and steal points at the foul line … A savvy veteran who can contribute meaningful minutes running a second unit with efficiency and leadership … Decent foul-shooter at 76% … Physical style should allow him to switch onto most perimeter players and even into the post if need be … High IQ on both ends of the floor
Weaknesses:
Doesn’t boast great size or length at just 6’2 barefoot with a 6’7.5 wingspan as a combo gaurd … Not very gifted athletically, although he seems to make up for it with his craftiness and poise (33 inch vertical is below NBA average for guards) … Won’t blow by a defender to create penetration or get to the rim with pace … One of the oldest prospects in the draft class at 24 years old (October 22nd) by opening night … The exclusion of a five-second rule with your back to the basket in college allowed Pickett to stay patient backing players down, which he won’t be able to do at the next level … A lot of his effectiveness came with the time he was allotted to keep his back turned and keep his eyes on the shooters who would come open around him … Won’t match the athleticism of his counterparts in the backcourt, which will make it difficult for him to stay in front defensively … Although he can create immense space with his step-back jumper, the additional length in the NBA could provide more problems for him with his unorthodox style …

Derek Bast 6/11/23  Pickett essentially did everything for his Penn State team last season, guiding them to a record of 19-12 and incredible run in the Big Ten tournament. He led the team in scoring, rebounding, assists and steals which all contributed to a very well-rounded season. He’s a smart, fundamentally sound prospect with playmaking upside.

Pickett was super effective offensively last season as he knocked down 39% of his 3.5 attempts from beyond the arc, along with created for teammates as he generated seven assists per game. On both ends of the floor he played unorthodox for his size, but it was highly effective.
The Penn State product has the ability to play lead guard at 6-foot-4, but also possesses the strength to play bigger than his height. A good portion of his shot diet comes from closer to the rim, as his go-to is bullying defenders for easy buckets. While most guards don’t traditionally play a ton with their back to the basket, Pickett is the exception. He does it often and is extremely effective in doing so.

Given be plays bigger than his size, Pickett is a fantastic positional rebounder. With his strong frame, Pickett is also impactful defensively. He plays with high effort and energy which is contagious for teammates.
Pickett is one of those unorthodox players that actually makes it quite difficult to project his fit at the next level. He has plenty of translatable skills, but it will be interesting to see how exactly he impacts the NBA game. His natural feel for the game is impressive, so he should find his place as a role player in the right system. It will take a team that’s really willing to use his unorthodox strengths. 

A decorated five-year college athlete, Pickett played at Siena for three years before his final two at Penn State."
Leonard Miller,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Andray Blatche
Strengths:
Miller is a long 6’10 215 PF/C with nicely developing strength, and he should only continue to fill out his frame in the future … Solid run-jump athlete that is most effective on the move … Has plenty of success as a rim-runner; can get up and down the floor before other big guys and did a great job of finishing strong around the hoop (60 FG% inside the arc) … Also shows good timing as a cutter and when operating as a roller in the screening game, being someone who can chip in easy points without having plays directly called for him (18 PPG on 55 FG%) … Nice hands and touch in close near the rim … Strong rebounding skills, particularly on the offensive glass, where he must be located to box out when shots go up and is a factor getting 2nd chance points (11 RPG, 3.2 ORPG) … On the defensive glass he shows flashes of being able to lead the break after grabbing missed shots, and he capable of handling the ball some in the open court … Above average 1st step for a 6’10 player and usually has a quickness advantage to face up & take bigs off the bounce when playing C … Has the tools to be able to successfully defend all along the frontcourt, with the footwork to switch on the perimeter and the budding strength to defend post-ups … Length (7’2 wingspan) makes him a more difficult matchup to shoot over and he showed flashes as a rim protector, especially as a weakside defender (0.9 BPG) … Plays to his strengths and sees the most success when he keeps it simple offensively … Made 79% of his FTs, which is encouraging to an extent for his potential to be a competent shooter as his range extends … His improvement from last year to now has been impressive; still continuing to make strides as a prospect and is a bit of a late bloomer …
Weaknesses:
Offensive skill level is raw and has some fundamentals that need to be refined, particularly in the halfcourt … Struggles as a floor spacer (32.7 3FG% on 2.2 3FGA/G); has a slow, mechanical shooting form that often led to flat misses … Too much wasted lower body motion and inconsistent footwork getting into his shot when spotting up … Plays with a high center of gravity operating with the ball that makes him susceptible to getting pick pocketed in traffic by help defenders and even sometimes on the ball … Not much of a shot creator against set defenses and generally has to find ways to get points by moving off the ball … Can struggle as a decision maker with the ball if you take away the things he wants to do or pressure him and make him read & react to action on the fly … Doesn’t really operate as a low block post scorer; prefers to face the basket almost exclusively … Budding playmaking ability but needs polish and to improve his feel and vision; will telegraph passes and at times commit awkward turnovers on what should be routine plays … Defensive fundamentals could use some work; his high center of gravity works against him here as well … Has struggled to sink his hips and chop his feet to keep the ball and man in front of him, which led to him being vulnerable against quick slashers and shot fakes on the perimeter … More of a PF than a wing or a big man, as he has some traits for both the perimeter and the paint but doesn’t exclusively play either role …
Overall:
Leonard Miller is a Canadian-bred prospect who played basketball in the Ontario area & represented Canada on the FIBA U16 team before transferring to schools in Utah & Florida to make a name for himself … After struggling with injuries and receiving little playing time he transferred back to Canada and began to emerge in around the fall of 2021 as a late blooming frontcourt player who had a big growth spurt (reportedly from 6’5 to 6’10 in less than 2 years) and made even more of a name for himself in the limited action he saw in the 2022 Nike Hoop Summit … Shortly after, he declared for the 2022 NBA Draft, presumably to get feedback heading into this past season, and after a month he decided to withdraw and join the G-League Ignite program as an 18 year old…He enjoyed an overall solid season where he continued to show the rim-running athleticism, flashes of open court handling and passing, while also showing encouraging defensive potential guarding near the basket … He still is learning the nuances of the game and is a bit of a project right now, with his athleticism and physical tools being ahead of his skill level at the moment…But his production was pretty impressive given his lack of experience and overall polish (14 double doubles in 24 games during the ‘22-23 season) and offers hope that he can develop into a worthwhile frontcourt guy who can play defense against modern NBA style frontcourt guys while also being a solid offensive contributor without having plays drawn up for him … He’s still growing into himself and getting used to operating the frontcourt, but he is an upside pick that teams in the mid to late 1st round will be intrigued by considering the strides he made from last summer until now …

Jorrye Nixon 6/14.23  As the youngest player currently projected to be drafted, not turning 19 until late November, Miller's lack of experience was evident in his two games at the NBA combine, where he shot just 7-of-18 from the field and looked a step slow with his decision-making and off-ball awareness defensively. Miller is using the pre-draft process to learn what he needs to work on to become the high-level player his sky-high potential suggests, and he walked out of Chicago with a long list of things he'll have to improve on long-term. None of this should be a surprise considering Miller was a 6-5, non-shooting guard just a few years ago, before hitting a late growth spurt and blossoming into a five-star-caliber prospect as a high school senior. Unlikely to secure the first-round assurances he's seeking, Miller will now likely be picking between attending college at Arizona and spending a year in the G League Ignite program. -- Jonathan Givony  Although he had quite a bit of interest from teams leading up to the 2022 NBA Draft, Miller ultimately dropped out of the process and decided to spend a year in the G League with the Ignite. The Canadian forward attended the combine and looked solid, but bet on himself showing improvement to potentially be selected higher than he would have the year prior.

For his size, Miller has good perimeter feel. He's comfortable with the ball in his hands and is confident in his overall game. What has concerned scouts up to this point has been his jumper and decision making. While the 6-foot-10 forward shows flashes of tremendous upside, he has just as many moments where he looks like an unfinished product that will need time to truly adjust to the NBA game. 
Miller's jump shot doesn't look great mechanically, which is likely why he isn't efficient from beyond the arc. The lefty has no problem getting to the rim in the halfcourt and running the break in transition, but to reach his ceiling the jumper will need quite a bit of work. At this point, he's simply not a good shooter outside of the paint. 

While he did show improvement this season as a playmaker and did a decent job of limiting the turnovers and mistakes, Miller really needs to flash those things in the pre-draft process. This will help in his showcasing his potential of being a point forward, which NBA teams love in the modern game.
The defense for Miller is promising, as he's got great size and is able to move his feet well. This should allow him to guard multiple positions moving forward. He still is somewhat undisciplined on that side of the ball, but playing in the G League system helped quite a bit over the past year.
Last season in the G League, he got to play with and against NBA level talent all season. In fact, with two other potential first-round picks in Scoot Henderson and Sidy Cissoko playing alongside him with the Ignite there was plenty of opportunity for Miller to prove he's an elite talent. 

Overall, until Miller shows more consistency, he projects to potentially be a high risk, high reward type of player. The upside is certainly there, but will be put everything together? The shooting in pre-draft workouts could be a swing factor for his positioning on boards entering June."

Derek Bast 6/3/23  Jones turned himself into one of the most well-rounded players in college as a young junior, propelling Xavier to an outstanding season while emerging as an All-Big East player. Tasked with defending point guards through power forwards, while shouldering significant playmaking responsibilities, Jones' versatility and feel for the game are well-suited for the NBA, especially now that he has become a 38% 3-point shooter. His average explosiveness and at times shaky free throw shooting (64%) are two questions NBA teams have, and he is generally the type of prospect whose resume is built more around productivity and winning than incredible upside, meaning taking his team on a deep tournament run could be highly beneficial to cement his candidacy.-- Jonathan Givony
  Jones has been on draft radars dating back to his late high school days as a four-star recruit into his freshman college season in 2020, but has really emerged as a legitimate NBA prospect early in this season.
He’s got great positional size at 6-foot-6, with the ability to play either guard position or slide over to the wing. While Jones can run point, it’s more likely he plays off ball at the next level. He can certainly pass well, but not necessarily set others up at a high level.
Although he will be 21 on draft night, the versatility the Xavier junior brings will be intriguing to teams.
Jones scores well off the bounce, with effective scoring tactics in the midrange and at the rim. He lacks an elite first step and isn’t a crazy athlete, but uses his size and length to his advantage. Furthermore on the offensive end, he moves well without the ball which puts him in the right position to score efficiently.
Overall, he’s a very fundamentally sound player on that end, doing the little things right rather than trying to be too flashy.
Where Jones really struggles is from beyond the arc. Interestingly enough, the mechanics of his jumper aren’t bad. His shot is somewhat slow due to him bringing the ball down on the catch, but he’s got a tight and smooth stroke that passes the eye test. Regardless, this will be the absolute swing skill for him and could dramatically impact where he’s taken on draft night, whether positive or negative.
Jones was a decent free throw shooter as a freshman, but has shot below 70% from the stripe in two consecutive seasons. Given free throw shooting can often be indicative of future shooting success from the perimeter that's an interesting data point. 
On the flip side, he is an improving playmaker, starting to get better at creating for himself as his role increases through the years. His assist numbers have steadily gone up in every one of his college seasons at Xavier.
One of the most promising things for the third year college player is his rebounding numbers. Not only can he play either guard position, but he also rebounds like a big. As a sophomore, Jones pulled down an outstanding 7.3 boards per game. In the modern NBA, this will allow him to play in undersized lineups as a potential stretch four.
On the defensive end, Jones absolutely has upside, but needs to limit the mistakes. There’s been moments in which he plays undisciplined defense at times, but can guard four positions well nonetheless.
When thinking about the overall game of Jones, he’s truly a hybrid guard that can play forward. He’s smart, versatile and fundamentally sound. These are the types of players that don’t have the most jaw-dropping highlights, but impact winning and get noticed by scouts.
Entering this season, Jones was deservedly on the preseason All-BIG EAST First Team. This came after being named the NIT Most Outstanding Player last season, averaging a team-high 14.8 points and 6.9 rebounds per contest as the Musketeers won the tournament. In the biggest moment of his season, Jones even scored 21 points in the championship game.
While he could still be selected in the first round of the 2023 NBA Draft, the swing skill will be the 3-point shot. The pre-draft process and the way he shoots in front of teams could be a big deal relative to where Jones gets taken."
Julian Phillips,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Derrick Jones
Strengths:
Raw, physical specimen with plenty of upside … Phillips was a McDonald’s All-American and 5-star recruit … Had modest success this past year as a freshman at Tennessee, but reportedly has been shining at pre draft events … At 6’8″ with a near 7′ wingspan, Julian has great size for the wing/forward position at the NBA level … Athletic ability is elite  … A player with “defensive versatility” to ultimately defend both 3 and 4 positions …. Led the entire 2023 NBA Draft Combine in vertical leap, jumping an eye-popping 43″ … This translates well to being a great open court finisher, rim runner, defender and rebounder at the next level … Watching Julian play, what stands out is indeed his explosiveness … Along with the physical tools, Phillips is also a highly interested, gritty, and tenacious defender, especially on the ball, making him a terror for opponents … This should translate immediately to the NBA … Phillips will mix it up and take a charge, and can be relied upon to absolutely hound the ball handler … His tenacity can also be seen on the boards … He averaged a strong, nearly two offensive rebounds per game… Offensively, Phillips is very raw … Has decent finishing ability around the hoop … Can catch an alley oop, lob pass … 82% from the FT line suggests he can become a better shooter from the floor …
Weaknesses:
At Tennessee, was used sparingly in the offense… Went long periods without scoring, sometimes looked disengaged offensively … Struggled to be involved offensively and was not very efficient when he did get opportunities, 8.3 ppg, 41.1 FG% … Phillips cureently struggles to initiate offense for himself and does not have much of an outside shot to speak of. He converted on just 24% of his three-pointers at Tennessee on just over one attempt per game … The physical tools are there … He will need to work on focus and consistency … He’d benefit from continuing to develop his handle … He was not asked much to playmaker nor create his own shot last season … Doesn’t have any specific go-to offensive moves … Phillips suffered from a bit of instability between his high school senior year and freshman year of college (he de-committed from LSU after the coach was fired and instead decided to attend Tennessee) …
Overall:
Phillips remains an immense physical talent and passes the eye test as a guy who can stick in the NBA for many years to come … He will need to work on consistency, especially offensively, and continue to tap into his defensive tenacity and potential finishing around the hoop … Getting into an NBA weight program should help him become a stronger defender and able to battle in the paint …
Notes:

After LSU head coach Will Wade was fired, Phillips requested and was granted a release from his NLI and reopened his recruitment … Son of Kim and Chamberlain, who both served with and retired from the U.S. Army …
Drew Wolin 6/22/23  Phillips went scoreless in Tennessee's Sweet 16 exit at the hands of Florida Atlantic. Phillips lost his starting spot because of an ankle injury in mid-February and ended up playing just 46 minutes in the NCAA tournament over three games, scoring five points on 2-for-8 shooting.  Phillips didn't have a very productive freshman season, struggling in a minor role to score with efficiency, shooting 47% inside the arc and 24% outside it. He doesn't have a consistent means of scoring, struggles to make open jumpers, lacks ballhandling ability and sees his best production via running in the open floor, crashing the offensive glass and cuts.  But Phillips' positional size, length and frame give him some long-term upside, which could be intriguing enough for a second-round flier. He looks the part of a big-time small forward prospect and sometimes plays like it, too, bringing good energy crashing the offensive glass and showing some multi-positional defensive versatility with his intensity and physical tools.  Workouts will play a key role in deciding how high in the second round Phillips could be picked, but there's a compelling case for him to return for another year in college.-- Jonathan Givony
 Tennessee was projected to have one of the best wings in the country this season in Phillips. With great positional size at 6-foot-8, he was used in many different ways on both ends of the floor. His length allowed him to guard multiple positions at a high level, which will make him very attractive to NBA teams.

With that in mind, he still didn't show as much as many had hoped. He was a solid player as a freshman, but didn't lock himself in as a first rounder this summer.
If Phillips can improve as a shooter, it’s easy to see a scenario in which he becomes a highly impactful 3-and-D wing. It’s not that his shot is bad now, but he is somewhat limited. He’s proven to be effective in catch-and-shoot situations from both the midrange and beyond the arc, but Phillips hasn’t had to convert on more difficult looks.
At the next level, shots have to get off more quickly and are very rarely uncontested. In general, whether or not Phillips can generate his own shot at the next level and score in isolation will be interesting.

Even if he doesn’t evolve into a shot creator, he’s still effective when he’s created for and in transition. He’s able to use his athleticism and length on the break to get easy buckets. Phillips is also a fantastic cutter, always finding himself in the right place on offense. This knack for finding the ball is also something that’s resulted in him pulling down offensive rebounds at a high rate.
What’s really impressive about Phillips is how good he is with both of his hands. Whether it’s the direction he drives the ball or the hand he finishes with at the rim, he’s effective left or right.
The swing factors for the freshman will be getting stronger and becoming more of a creator. Either way, he'll have the chance to showcase his talent in the pre-draft process and could be a riser.

Before landing at Tennessee, Phillips was offered an $800,000 contract with the G League Ignite and also considered joining Overtime Elite. The five-star prospect really broke out his senior season and emerged as one of the best wings in his class. During that final high school season, he led Link Academy to 33-2 record and a trip to the GEICO National Championship game."

Derek Bast 5/30/23  Jackson's virtues as an NBA prospect were on display in UConn's four-game run to the NCAA Final Four, with spectacular plays highlighting his explosive physical attributes and defensive versatility. He had 31 assists, 28 rebounds and a barrage of winning plays in key moments.  Jackson's ability to ignite the break pushing in the open court and spray passes everywhere has factored into UConn's postseason success, as he regularly goes into the paint with outstanding speed to find shooters on the wing driving and kickout. He's a major connector in the half court with touch passes, lobs, dribble handoffs and timely cuts off the ball, especially when Gonzaga didn't guard him.  Jackson's lack of perimeter shooting (28% from 3, 65% free throws), average ballhandling in the half court, and overall struggles as a scorer haven't been as much of an issue the past two weekends as they were at points in the regular season, where his team often looked like they were playing 5-on-4 with the way opponents ignored him off the ball. Players in this mold can be difficult to hide in the NBA, but UConn has done everything it can to accentuate Jackson's strengths the past few weeks, giving him a stronger case as a first-round pick. He still has the runway of the Final Four and a potential national championship to continue to build his resume. -- Jonathan Givony

In terms of physical build, Jackson is fit for the NBA. At 6-foot-6, he’s got the size and skills to play wing, but is also more of a natural guard. This should result in versatility at the next level. That's exactly what we saw during UConn's championship run, as he was one of the most important players on that entire roster, which certainly helped his draft stock.
For his size, Jackson has really good speed to go along with incredible bounce. He’s a bit lanky, but makes up for it with explosiveness and length.
The primary question surrounding the UConn guard is the jumper. Mechanically, he’s got a bit of a hitch and the load up is interesting. Jackson has a high release, but it’s seemingly far away from his body and is more of a push than a shot. This is visible both from beyond the arc and even the free throw line.
While he shot 36.1% from deep as a sophomore but, his freshman and junior numbers have not been anywhere near that. Unless something drastic happens to close out this season, his sophomore sample size will look like an anomaly that can’t be trusted
Even outside of the jump shot, his offensive game needs work overall. He’s not a very polished scorer, and often looks unorthodox as he looks to generate a shot.
After averaging just 2.8 points as a freshman and 6.8 as a sophomore, Jackson hasn’t shown much more improvement as an overall scorer. He’s still not a real threat to ever produce 20 points in a game and rarely has double-digit scoring outings.
With that in mind, he’s not a bad offensive player. This is due to his tremendous upside as a passer and facilitator. Jackson’s passes are tight and his assist numbers are way up this season. He’s really emerged as one of the better playmakers for others, which does counter some of the lack of scoring.
As it relates to his athleticism, Jackson is a highlight dunker, which is something he’s been doing since he was 12 years old. This makes him a monster in transition, both offensively and defensively.
Speaking of defense, that’s where he really thrives. Jackson is absolutely a high upside defender that could make an impact at the NBA level. He’s a good positional shot blocker and also averages more than a steal per game. The junior has good natural instincts on that end of the floor and uses his athleticism and quickness very well.
If Jackson can come around as a perimeter shooter, a hyper athletic 3-and-D player is what he could be at the next level. If not, there’s questions around what his role could be. On the bright side, he’s a good leader and a very smart individual.

Playing on one of the best teams in the country, Jackson made up a great backcourt with Jordan Hawkins at UConn. This goes to show that he can play well off of another top-level player and also contributes to winning at the highest level.
The former four-star, top 50 recruit out of Albany Academy has taken a few years at the college level to round out his game, but will get real consideration in the 2023 NBA Draft.
He’s got basketball in his DNA as both parents played college ball. At this point, it’s about finishing the season strong and improving the jumper to move beyond the college level."

Floor spacing wing with great size and tremendous experience as a five-year contributor for the Clemson Tigers … Catch-and-shoot specialist who shot over 40% from beyond the arc as a super senior on six attempts per game … High release on his jumper allows him to shoot over aggressive closeouts, even over players with NBA size … Instant contributor who can fill out a rotation as a shooting threat who moves intelligently and is always ready to pull a quick trigger … Shoots well on the move and in spot ups … Elite rebounder by every definition. Averaged 9.6 rebounds per game this season … Can step into long two’s and exploit undisciplined closeouts … Takes care of the basketball with only one turnover per game this season … Efficient scorer from everywhere on the floor (58% from 2PT, 40.5% from 3 PT and 84% from FT) … Potential 50/40/90 role player with NBA size and veteran presence … Performed at an elite level in shooting drills at the 2023 G-League Elite Camp. Earned a call-up to the 2023 NBA Draft Combine for his efforts … Stays out of foul trouble. Should be able to contribute solid minutes and stay on the floor because of it … Improved each season at Clemson, growing into much more than a shooter with a 15-point average this season … Can take advantage of mismatches in the post with a decent post-scoring bag and a sound fadeaway jumper … Good finisher when he gets to the hoop
Weaknesses:
Not much of a shot creator and one of the oldest players in the draft at 23 years old … Will struggle to separate and get open looks for himself off the dribble … Doesn’t project to be much more than a shooter on the wing … Below average athlete who gets beat off the dribble often and rarely contests shots inside the arc. Could often be the guy that opponents exploit on defense both in the post and on the perimeter … Doesn’t have great length for his height, which can be seen with the lack of steal/block production on defense … Will need to improve drastically on the defensive end to earn consistent minutes … If his shot isn’t falling, he provides little value to an NBA team
Notes:
Measured 6’7.50 barefoot, 8’9.00 standing reach, 208.8 lbs, 6’9.75 wingspan with a 28.5 inch standing vertical and 30.5 inch max vertical leap at 2023 G-League Elite Camp … 2023 All-ACC First Team … 2023 Karl Malone Award Finalist … Drafted 37th overall by the Denver Nuggets in the 2023 NBA Draft …
Derek Bast 6/22/23  Over the past five seasons at Clemson, Tyson has really shown a tremendous level of development. He went from a freshman playing an extremely small role to scoring the most points for the Tigers last season. A nearly 7-foot forward, he has legitimate 3-point shooting upside. While he’s an older prospect, he checks quite a few NBA boxes and has flourished of late.
NBA teams always value size and shooting, a combination that Tyson immediately brings to a team alongside toughness and feel. He’s a career 36% 3-point shooter (462 attempts) that shot 40% from deep on a career high 6 attempts per game this past season. Not only can Tyson shoot it from deep, but he also converted on almost 60% of his twos last season. He's also a much improved rebounder, pulling down nearly 10 boards per game in his recent campaign. 
Tyson has continued to improve his stock during the pre-draft process, performing at a high level in every opportunity he gets. This started with the Portsmouth Invitational Tournament, where he absolutely torched the nets. He knocked down 5-of-7 from deep en route to 21 points in his first outing. He flashed his range, confidence and shotmaking versatility including catch-and-shoot, movement and contested makes. 
Unfortunately, Tyson PIT’s run ended in the second quarter of his second game after tweaking his ankle on a made three through contact. His performance was enough to earn an invite to the G League Ignite Camp last month. He finished top three in three out of the four shooting drills. He wasn’t shy at all in the scrimmages as he was third in most field goals attempted during the two games. The combination of size and elite shooting ability led to him getting invited to the NBA Draft Combine.
Again, Tyson has performed at a high level in every major pre-draft event which earned him a spot at the combine. Shooters with his size are a wanted commodity at the next level, so it wouldn’t be surprising to hear his name late in the second round of the 2023 NBA Draft."
Jordan Walsh,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: DeMarre Carroll/Renaldo Balkman
Strengths:
Walsh is a physically gifted 6’7 205 wing with massive length (7’2 wingspan) that allows him to play much bigger and has the frame to easily add muscle … Good, rangy-type athleticism and movement skills; a long strider who runs the floor very well and is a factor in transition … An above the rim finisher who shows strong leaping ability … Really good projections as a versatile defensive player at the pro level; is competitive and instinctive with the active feet and toughness to guard PG-PF, especially as he fills out his frame … Knows how to use his length and athleticism to get back in plays when beat and consistently shows a high motor … Smothers players on the perimeter when defending at the point of attack and is a very hard player to shoot over when he keeps his hands up … Physical tools allow him to be a factor off the ball as he can rotate to disrupt slashers and still get back to close out and contest on jump shooters … Active hands to strip the ball, get deflections and pick pocket ball-handlers (1.1 SPG)…Instincts and hustle also flash on the offensive glass at times (43 offensive rebounds as a Fr), where he can highpoint some misses for 2nd chance points and even if he can’t corral boards he will tip the ball out for others to retain possessions … Is comfortable handling the ball in transition and is a simple, yet effective passer on the move … Will make the extra pass and generally doesn’t force the issue … Solid job moving without the ball and can get himself some easy baskets by cutting to open spots around the rim … Willing to sacrifice his body for loose balls and extra possessions … Contributes in multiple ways, some that may not show up in box scores, and seems to be an unselfish teammate willing to do whatever to win …
Weaknesses:
Offensive game is a major work in progress; particularly in the half court … Arkansas struggled hitting the deep ball all season long and his lack of shooting skills, even when in rhythm or left open, was one of the main reasons why the floor spacing in their offense was poor (27.8 3FG%, only 20 total 3s made as a Fr.) … High, yet slow release, mediocre touch and inconsistent footwork; will need significant improvement and time with a shooting coach to even get close to league-average range as a floor spacer … Very little mid-range game to pull-up for closer shots too … Often passes up open shots and tends to be a pretty easy player to guard, particularly 1-on-1 … Not a scorer; 18 points was his season-high as a Fr. and took 10 or more shots in only 3 games this past season (7.2 PPG) … Nothing special as a ball-handler, mostly a north-south slasher with minimal misdirection or shiftiness to his game … Mediocre efficiency as a finisher for someone with his physical tools and athleticism (51 FG% inside the arc) … Wont get to the FT line very often (1.8 FTA/G on 71 FT%) … Currently operates more like a PF than a wing offensively in terms of skill set and role … Has some playmaking skills that can be harnessed, but they are raw (0.9:1 A:TO) and teams lack of respect for his shooting skills often led to defenders sagging off and cutting off passing lanes … Can be overly reliant on his tools defensively and get very handsy and undisciplined on the perimeter, though he did get better about it as the season went on (2.9 fpg; fouled out of 7 games in ‘22-23)…  Foul trouble and shooting woes often limited his playing time last season, and he was demoted from starter to reserve during the SEC slate (24.4 MPG) … Green prospect with a fairly wide range of skills that need to be polished for him to reach his potential … Plays somewhat passive, not fully utilizing his athletic gifts with finishes around the rim as often as he should …
Overall:
Jordan Walsh was a highly touted, consensus 5-star recruit originally from the Dallas area before playing for the Link Academy as a Sr…He was a McDonalds All-American and part of an Arkansas recruiting class that was the highest rated in the country by some recruiting sites, which led to high preseason expectations after their trip to the Elite 8 in 2022…Walsh entered his Fr. season as a starter at forward and a projected 1st round pick in 2023 mock drafts, but seemed to have had growing pains adjusting to the speed of the game and often struggling to defend without fouling and assert himself offensively…He was eventually demoted to a reverse player, but seemed to buy in and settle into the role of a Swiss Army knife type off the Arkansas bench as the SEC conference kicked up and became a pretty invaluable player in their rotation with his timely deflections, suffocating on-ball defense, clutch offensive rebounds and overall knack for making winning plays…Due to his improved play during the critical stretch for an Arkansas team that struggled during the regular season but made it to the Sweet 16 in the 2023 NCAA tourney, Walsh revitalized himself into a prospect to monitor in 2023 Draft convos again after falling out of many mocks earlier in the season, which he further built on after a pretty good NBA Combine week in May…His tantalizing length, athleticism, intangibles and instinctive feel for the game on both ends of the floor are intriguing and teams will look to further build off those skills and traits…Still, there are some glaring holes in his game, as he is a major project on the offensive end, where he was often a liability against set defenses due to his poor shooting and underwhelming overall skill level with the ball…He also will need to work on staying out of foul trouble so his coaches can eventually trust him with an extended workload…Still, there is some upside with Walsh that is worth a team tapping into for the future and it seems that he has built his stock back up enough over the past few months that he’ll have a really good chance of hearing his name called in the 2nd round of the 2023 Draft …
Notes:
Measured: 6′ 5.75” barefoot, 8′ 11.00” standing reach, 204.0 lbs, 7′ 1.75” wingspan, and a 36 inch maximum vertical at the 2023 NBA Draft Combine …

Displays athleticism in the open floor and finds dunk opportunities in the half-court as well … Versatile skill set … Natural and aggressive scorer. Good variety as a scorer, reads opportunities well and can usually convert taking what the defense gives him. While he can get out of control at times, he can create offense out of nothing … Changes speed and direction well with the ball. Effective slasher and covers a lot of ground on drives. Can finish with either hand. Scores in the crowded paint and doesn’t shy away from physicality … Draws fouls at a good rate … Can score in the post, utilizes his size mismatch well … Good tools, intensity, and versatility on the defensive end, showing a lot of potential as a two-way wing. Can lock in on the ball and disrupts the ball-handler, defends off the ball and jumps passes, and can turn defense into offense. Averaged 2 steals per game at each Nike EYBL, NBPA Top 100 (2nd best), and Pangos All-American Camp (1st) in 2021 … Effortless shot and range extends to the 3PT line. Can hit shots off the dribble … Generally, a reliable free throw shooter. Shot 90% FT% at the NBPA Top 100 in 2021 … Can thread the needle and is capable of making nice passes. Plays well in transition as both a leader and finisher … Good rebounder for position. Averaged 7.4 rebounds (2.7 offensive) per game over the Nike EYBL in 2021 … Vocal … Assertive, plays hard, and his presence is always felt when he’s on the floor. Never goes through the motions. Highly confident and competitive, doesn’t second guess himself …
Weaknesses:
Can improve shooting consistency and scoring efficiency. Averaged 12.3 points per game on 46.8% FG% over the Nike EYBL and 6.8 points per game on 29.4% FG% at the NBPA Top 100 in 2021 … Shot 18.8% 3PT% on 1.3 3PT attempts per game over the Nike EYBL and 10.5% 3PT% on 3.2 3PT attempts per game at the NBPA Top 100 in 2021 … Can improve defensive positioning and fundamentals. Leaves his feet, reaches in, and picks up unnecessary fouls at times … Can be very turnover prone, playing loose and trying to do too much. Has room to tighten up as a ball-handler. Throws wild passes at times, isn’t afraid to attempt one-hand full-court passes, among other home run plays, and can improve decision making overall. Looks for fouls and ends up on the floor somewhat often … Wears his emotions at times …
Outlook:
Incoming Arkansas freshman … Transferred to Link Academy for his senior year … 2022 McDonald’s All-American … Named to the 2022 Jordan Brand Classic … 2021 Les Schwab Invitational MVP …
Evan Tomes 7/26/22  Walsh, the No. 39 prospect in ESPN's draft projections, improved his standing with teams at the draft combine by posting 15 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists in 40 minutes of action while demonstrating impressive defensive versatility with his 7-foot-2 wingspan. Walsh averaged 7.1 points, 3.9 rebounds and 1.1 steals in 24 minutes per game at Arkansas as a freshman. He helped the Razorbacks to the NCAA tournament's Sweet 16, defeating No. 1 overall seed Kansas and losing to eventual national champion UConn. At 19 years old, featuring elite physical tools and the ability to guard point guards through power forwards, he still has considerable room to improve his jump shot, and his overall offensive game continues to gain consistency. -- Jonathan Givony
 As an overall prospect, Walsh has the potential to be one of the most versatile players in the upcoming draft. He’s got the skills and intangibles to do nearly everything effectively. If he’s able to improve in just a few areas, he’ll be one of those players that can impact the game in any way.
Walsh is currently more of a stretch four, but we project he’ll be a wing longer term. For now, being a combo forward isn’t a bad place to be.
A disruptive defender, the five-star prospect has a 7-foot-3 wingspan which allows him to effectually guard three to four positions. As a whole, that side of the floor is a real strength for him.
Walsh played at Arkansas on one of the best young rosters in the country this season. There’s three players outside of Walsh in Nick Smith Jr., Anthony Black and Ricky Council IV that have legitimate first-round upside.
On the offensive end, Walsh is best in transition where he can play above the rim. Given the type of defender he is, the 6-foot-7 wing is often running the break.
While Walsh has a smooth jumper with a high release and good mechanics, he’s got a long way to go as a shooter. The shot looks good, but doesn’t fall at efficient rate from deep. Shooting consistency is what he will need to prove to teams most leading up to the 2023 NBA Draft.
The freshman is a solid free throw shooter, which is promising as it relates to his 3-point shot long-term.
Walsh is a good slasher and is comfortable operating in the post. If he’s got an undersized defender on him, he’s able to be effective in utilizing his size to get a bucket. He has a high IQ and is a good passer for his position, but does have moments in which he turns the ball over at a high rate. Walsh also projects to be a quality rebounder for a perimeter oriented player.
He's an energy guy that can truly impact the momentum of a game.
Overall, he was one of the better two-way players in the country last season. As a senior at Link Academy, he led the team to the finals of the GEICO Nationals, playing alongside another first-round talent in Julian Phillips (Tennessee).
The Texas native often flirted with double-doubles on the EYBL circuit. Although overshadowed at Arkansas, he should be a great contributor on both ends at the next level."
Mouhamed Gueye,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Solomon Alabi
Strengths:
Wiry 6’10 center who advanced his game immensely after receiving feedback from NBA scouts and executives after his freshman season. Some of his developments included free-throw shooting (49% to 67% on double the attempts), court vision and passing execution (0.5 AST to 1.9 AST) and confident scoring (7.4 to 14.3 points per game) … Clearly very coachable player … Not just willing to shoot from beyond the arc, but also looks comfortable in his shooting stroke but below average efficiency (27% 3-PT) … Extremely mobile big man who can pop out of screens and slip to the basket quickly … Comfortable putting the ball on the deck and getting to the basket if the lane is there. Won’t force it if it’s not there … Can score in face ups as well as post ups. Has a decent mid-range jumper in that role … Energetic rebounder, on both ends, who thrives especially on the offensive glass with 3.4 per game as a sophomore … High upside big who can eventually spread the floor and be a fierce rim protector as he develops … Has the frame and athletic traits to be a long-term starter if he receives the right coaching and continues to build on the growth he’s made … Looks extremely polished considering he never played a game of organized basketball until he moved to the United States at age 16 … Could eventually be a solid draft pick, but will require patience … Despite having low efficiency shooting numbers, his form actually shows promise …
Weaknesses:
Still an extremely raw prospect who likely won’t be able to see the floor in big minutes … Good mobility, but  lacking in fluidity … Doesn’t have the strength to hang with the physical centers in the NBA … Likely to struggle to add strength with his body type … Never showed a ton of production as a shot-blocker, although he plays with the leaping ability to change that as he learns the timing and positioning he needs … Can be lackadaisical in offensive sets that require him to initiate at the top of the key … Looks to be a fast learner, but when sets don’t go according to plan, he looks lost and often turns the ball over … Still not a totally reliable shooter from the perimeter … Needs to be a much more productive defender as an NBA center. Block rate will only go down as he is forced to roam outside the paint … Jarringly inefficient for a big man with a sub-50% field goal percentage in each of his two seasons in college … Struggles to score over lengthier centers. Doesn’t boast a wide array of post moves and doesn’t use his body well enough to create the space he needs to score over either shoulder … Not NBA ready … Probably benefited from a weak class of centers …
Notes:
Measured: 6’10.5” barefoot, 6’11.75” in shoes, 9’2.5” standing reach, 202.8 lbs, 7’3.75” wingspan at the 2022 NBA G-League Elite Camp … Measured 6′ 10.25” barefoot, 9′ 2.50” standing reach, 212.6 lbs and a 7′ 3.25” wingspan at the 2023 NBA Draft Combine …Two-year starter at Washington State … 2022 Pac-12 All-Freshman Team … 2023 All-Pac-12 First Team … Led Prolific Prep to GEICO Nationals, becoming the first CA school to play in the event … Born in Dakar, Senegal … Moved to the United States as a 16-year-old … Drafted 39th overall in the 2023 NBA Draft by the Charlotte Hornets, acquired by Atlanta Hawks …
Derek Bast 6/22/23  Gueye is faced with the tall task of winning four games in four days to secure a spot in the NCAA tournament, but NBA scouts will be encouraged by the progress he has shown as a sophomore, something he can continue to build on with a strong Pac-12 tournament. The 7-footer with a 7-4 wingspan is one of the most explosive players in college, and he has been able to show more wrinkles this season as the focal point of Washington State's offense, be it creating for himself or others while facing the basket, in the post, as a roller, running the floor or crashing the offensive glass.

Gueye's lack of strength, average feel for the game and limitations as a perimeter shooter and decision-maker still need to be ironed out, and there are questions about which position he's best suited guarding considering he weighs just 203 pounds, things that might ultimately cause him to return for another season. -- Jonathan Givony  A mobile, fluid forward, Gueye will have a real chance of being drafted this summer. He reclassified in high school and started college early, which is why he’s so young despite two seasons at Washington State under his belt. The 6-foot-11 prospect has a skillset that fits the modern game extremely well.
Gueye has been a starter essentially since day one at college level, but his role really increased as sophomore. He’s now a double-double machine following year two and leverages his size and athleticism well. He had one of the most productive seasons for a freshman in school history and built upon that recently as a sophomore.
The big from Senegal has shown some really impressive things in two seasons at the college level in the Pac-12. He played over 30 minutes per game as a sophomore and nearly doubled shot attempts year-over-year. While his efficiency didn’t rise like we would have liked to see, it was good to at least see Gueye somewhat maintain his splits from the floor with the scaled up volume. He’s a prospect that hovers around 50% on twos and just under 30% on triples.
Gueye is an elite offensive rebounder, pulling down nearly 3.5 per game as sophomore. His ability to generates second chance points is extremely valuable at any level. He’s also an underrated positional passer, dishing out roughly two assists per game last season.
In transition, he should fit the modern NBA game well. Gueye has good acceleration and runs the floor well for a forward. We wouldn’t call him a point forward, but he has good handles at 6-foot-11 and has no problem bringing the ball up the court upon pulling down a board. That’s a skill that every big needs to thrive at the next level.
Gueye has a smooth jumper, which could unlock quite a bit for him in the NBA. He’s still not a great 3-point shooter in terms of percentages, but the upside is really there. He’s solid in the midrange and is a much improved free throw shooter which is promising.
On the other end of the court, Gueye is pretty disruptive. He has a 7-foot-3 wingspan and moves really well. He isn’t as good of a shot blocker as he could be with the size and length, but he should naturally improve there.
At the high school level with Prolific Prep, Gueye was on a loaded roster and didn’t get to showcase all of the tools he had. He was still a top 50 recruit and has been able to preview all of his upside at the college level now.
Gueye was able to experience part of the pre-draft process this time last year, but this time around it feels like he won’t go back to school and will officially be selected on the night of the 2023 NBA Draft."
Maxwell Lewis,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Sean Elliott/Devin Vassel
Strengths:
Long, rangy athlete with a scorer’s mentality … A late bloomer who was somewhat unknown on the national level entering his sophomore season … Has blossomed into Pepperdine’s key player, and one of the top players in the nation, averaging 19 ppg on highly efficient 50/40/84 shooting splits … Very good shooting stroke with concise, fluid, repeatable motion … Has developed into a consistent and efficient scorer, taking the reigns for Pepperdine as the go to scoring option … Has demonstrated clutch play when they need a basket and has no problem shouldering a large chunk of the scoring load … Has the natural athleticism to play the wing on both ends at the next level … Very good catch and shoot ability. And can also get out in transition and make above the rim highlight finishes … Active on the glass at 6 rebounds per game … At just 20 years of age (turned in July), shows untapped physical potential. … Solid efficiency as a freshman at 11 ppg and efficient shooting clips (36% from 3, 80% FT) and has improved on those numbers … 2.7 assists per game shows some ability to find teammates when he’s unable to create for himself …
Weaknesses:
Lewis’ major weakness right now is his lack of defensive consistency, intensity and focus. He obviously showed the length and athleticism to be a solid defender but has a ways to go in becoming a dependable performer on that end of the floor … His offensive game would be greatly enhanced if his handles were better. Not proficient at beating opponents off the dribble and struggles to create when guarded by long, athletic opponents … Tends to get erratic and turn the ball over at times when he’s driving to the basket … Should look to add some weight to his frame to be able to finish stronger and become tougher defensively and on the boards … Basketball awareness still a work in progress, which is most apparent on the defensive end of the floor … Can get burned by his man off the ball and struggles some in the area of team defense … Level of competition at Pepperdine raises some question marks about his ability to perform at the same level of production and consistency against better players … Pepperdine has struggled to compete in Conference play, giving detractors fuel to criticize Lewis ability to carry team on his shoulders for wins …
Outlook:
Coach Romar who has coached numerous NBA players such as Brandon Roy,  Isaiah Thomas, Nate Robinson, Markelle Fultz, Dejounte Murray, Matisse Thybulle and Terrence Ross, said, “In 26 years as a head coach, I’ve never seen a player improve as much as (Lewis) has from the first day on campus until now. He’s made the biggest jump of anyone I’ve ever coached,” said Coach Romar …
Notes:
Native of Las Vegas, NV … Attended AZ Compass high school … An “accomplished” saxophonist … Measured 6′ 6.25” barefoot, 8′ 8.50” standing reach, 207.2 lbs and a 7′ 0.00” wingspan and a 32.5 inch standing vertical and a 36.5′ inch max vertical at the 2023 NBA Draft Combine …
Aran Smith 1/31/23  Lewis' season is already finished after Pepperdine limped to a 2-14 record in WCC play and a first-round exit in the conference tournament to lowly Pacific.

Lewis looked like he elected to enter the NBA draft in January and simply forgot to tell anyone, as he seemingly just went through the motions for much of conference play, shooting an alarming 47% from 2-point range and 26% from 3 with more turnovers than assists while playing even less defense than usual, even by his porous standards. Lewis will now need to answer difficult questions to convince teams in workouts and interviews that he's a better competitor than what he displayed, and that his situation and coaching staff had as much to do with his underachieving play.

Despite the red flags, there will be a long line of NBA teams looking to learn more about Lewis during the pre-draft process. Everyone is looking for fluid, long-armed 6-7 wings with shot creation, shot-making versatility and upside, especially late bloomers like him. -- Jonathan Givony  Lewis certainly has the upside to be more than a 3-and-D prospect, but at minimum if he can continue to knock down triples and be a versatile defender, he will have a spot in the NBA.
As a freshman, he was a solid 3-point shooter and even showcased the ability to make more advanced looks. The efficiency from deep went down in year two, but he was also the primary focus of opposing defenses and didn't have as many easy looks. His shot mechanics are slower than they’ll need to be at the next level, as he brings the ball down while loading up. Nonetheless, it’s a pretty shot that goes in at a good clip.
Lewis is also a strong driver, leveraging his strength and finishing power to get to the rim. He might not be lightning quick, but he’s patient with the ball in his hands while taking it to the rack. Surveying the floor for the right opportunity comes natural to the Pepperdine prospect and he has good change of speed in the midrange area.
With the ball in his hands, Lewis loves using pump fakes and jabs to get his defender off balance before taking them to the cup or pulling up. He can score on the move and has also been willing to post up smaller defenders.
As it relates to improvement, Lewis takes more difficult shot than he needs to sometimes. While he’s a good positional passer, he can also be turnover prone. He’s better as a situational facilitator than a full-time offensive lead. His assist numbers more than doubled from his freshman to sophomore year, but the turnovers also increased. 
On the flip side, he does have the ability to bring the ball up the court and has point forward upside. He’s also an efficient rebounder and has two-way impact.
Defensively, Lewis uses his length to block shots and generate deflections. He can be effective taking on guards or modern forwards, but has shown to sometimes lack the lateral quickness to stay in front of some players. He often makes up for that with his length and body control, but that’s certainly an area he can improve.
The baseline or floor for Lewis seems relatively high, it will just come down to how close he can get to his ceiling. The 6-foot-7 wing feels like a safe draft pick either way, assuming he has another good college season.
Growing up in a family full of athletes, playing at this level is nothing new for Lewis. He actually decided to forgo his senior year of high school to train for the 2021 NBA Draft, then ultimately ended up going the college route.
In his freshman season, he missed the first six games of the season waiting on NCAA eligibility, then the last five contests of the year with a wrist injury. On a larger sample size and increased role as a sophomore, his draft stock has really gone up. He was one of the more impressive prospects at the college level this season. 
After a WCC All-Freshman team nod, he earned All-WCC honors this season. While Lewis looked like a potential lottery pick early in the season, his numbers did fall off some later into the season. Nonetheless, it would be surprising if he didn't get taken in the first round of the 2023 NBA Draft."
Amari Bailey,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Jerryd Bayless
Strengths:
Bailey is a 6’4 190 southpaw guard with adequate length (6’7 wingspan) and strength to match up fine in the backcourt in most situations … Also is a decent athlete with solid leaping skills, body control and short area quickness … Able to competently operate both on and off the ball offensively, which will give teams some lineup flexibility when he’s on the court … Comfortable operating in the pick and roll game and can slash, pull up or make simple dump-offs to bigs depending on how he’s played (49.5 FG%, 2.2 APG) … Solid downhill dribble drive player; is a tricky guy for defenders to prevent from getting to the lane due to his good handle and 1st step … Strong enough to handle contact and convert near the hoop (52 FG% inside the arc as a Fr.) … Is effective in transition as well, where his footwork and creativity as a finisher shines most … Will occasionally make timely cuts to the rim behind the defense for easy layups … One of the better mid-range players in the 2023 Draft class; shoots a good amount of pull-up jumpers and is solid hitting them from the 15-18 ft area…Was efficient with his feet set and space on the perimeter as a Fr. too, though his attempts are limited (39 3FG%, 21 made 3s) … Tough defender; takes pride in guarding the other team’s top perimeter player and has the makings of a potential defensive stopper in the backcourt…Moves his feet and forces difficult shots, but also can be a pest with his active hands to get deflections and steals (1.1 SPG) … Good basketball IQ and on-court awareness; puts himself in position to make plays on both ends of the court … Competitive; seems to embrace physical play and doesn’t back down from challenges or big moments … Didn’t have the ball in his hands as much in college as expected, especially earlier in the season, but the experience playing off-ball could help mold his overall game..Hit stride and played his best basketball during the most critical stretch of his team’s season, which is something encouraging to build on …
Weaknesses:
More of a tweener than a combo guard at the moment on both ends of the court … Can operate as a secondary ball-handler but doesn’t have the playmaking instincts or natural feel for the game to be a true PG … In addition, doesn’t have the confidence in his 3-pointer or (in some matchups) the size to fit seamlessly on the wing full-time … More comfortable with the ball than without it, but his decision-making was often too spotty this past season and will need to continue to improve at the next level to justify on-ball responsibilities (2.2:2.4 A:TO) … Sometimes tries to force the action and has plenty of moments when he should pick his spots better … Doesn’t always handle help defense, traps or hedges well and tends to be a bit erratic when the defense collapses on him … Jump shooting mechanics need work; has a slower release and below average elevation which may limit the types of shots he can take against contests from NBA-level athletes and gives pause to his efficiency as a Fr. translating to the next level … Will pass up open jumpers on the perimeter and attempt lower percentage shots, a tendency that wont hold up if teams dive his screens and dare him to shoot (1.7 3FGA/G) … Not a creative scorer (11.2 PPG), wont show much misdirection or improvisation in his game … Below average production getting to and converting at the charity stripe for a guard (70 FT% on 2.1 FTA/G) … Some versatility offensively, but doesn’t particularly stand out in many areas …
Overall:
Amari Bailey has one of the most touted and highly scrutinized prospects over the past 5 years or so, having been featured on Lifetime’s “Bringing Up Ballers” at around 13 years old and making a name for himself playing on the Sierra Canyon program around the Los Angeles area during his HS years … He was a standout immediately as a Fr and was seen as the #1 player in the 2022 HS Class on many recruiting sites by the time it was his Sr. season … Injuries hampered him a bit in 21-22 but he still was a consensus 5-star recruit before going to UCLA and playing for Mick Cronin … Cronin is a no nonsense, defensive-minded coach that your typical blue chip recruit may struggle to adapt to, and Bailey unsurprisingly went through some of those growing pains that cooled off the lottery pick hype he had in the preseason … He was in a perimeter rotation that was full of experienced upperclassmen and had to play more of a secondary role for a chunk of the season, but a key injury allowed him to take on more responsibilities as his Fr. campaign progressed and he really started to thrive down the stretch on both ends of the court … He embraced the physical, assignment sound defensive approach of his coach and emerged as a strong 2-way player…It feels like Bailey didn’t get to showcase his offensive ability to the fullest extent at UCLA, but you could see the confidence grow and the speed of the game slow down for him as the year progressed…He also played well in pre-draft workouts and scrimmages to further solidify his stock and build on the momentum from the end of the season…NBA teams will be encouraged by Bailey’s toughness, defense, mid-range game, and competitive nature as a prospect … He offers some versatility and is willing to adapt his game to do whatever he can to help his team win … Improving his confidence as a shooter and his decision making with the ball will be key to determining his upside and what role he will play at the next level, but Bailey has re-established himself as a potential draft pick in the 2023 Draft and currently has projections in the early-to-mid 2nd round ,,,

Jorrye Nixon 6/16/23  Bailey entered the season as a projected first-rounder, but saw his stock fall as his adjustment to college basketball was far from seamless, struggling with decision-making, shot selection and his average physical tools as a finisher and one-on-one defender. He looked reluctant to take open jumpers due to his unconventional shooting mechanics, hit less than 70% of his free throw attempts and posted more turnovers than assists on the season.  Lately, Bailey has looked a lot more like the top-five high school recruit he was billed as than the second-round flier most NBA teams viewed him as. He's averaging 17 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 3.6 assists on sparkling efficiency (67% true shooting percentage) over his last five games, including two excellent NCAA tournament showings last weekend. He's playing with much more confidence, showing his excellent ball-handling ability, shiftiness changing speeds and getting in the paint, ability to pass off a live dribble and improved defense. There are still major question marks about his jump shot, but Bailey is doing a good job of rebuilding his stock and putting himself back in the picture as a potential first-round pick depending on how he continues to play and in the pre-draft process should he declare.-- Jonathan Givony
 A smooth lefty that is a legitimate two-way talent, Bailey made an immediate impact as a freshman at UCLA. He’s extremely athletic and plays with a fire that’s inspiring to his teammates. He makes plays that truly impact momentum and result in wins.

On the offensive end, Bailey is best in the midrange and at the rim. He’s got a lethal spin move that often results in him blowing by his defender. He’s also likes to use a variety of euro steps on a regular basis once he gets in the paint.
With that in mind, the 6-foot-4 guard heavily favors his left hand. He rarely goes right, but even when he does often resorts to using his left hand to finish. If Bailey is going to reach his ceiling, learning to go right and finish with that hand will be key.
The UCLA freshman is a good passer, but still has work to do as a decision maker. Too often with the ball in his hands he drives without purpose which results in turnovers. He actually produced more turnovers than assists in his lone college season. Elite guards see the game one step ahead of everyone else and he just isn’t quite there yet. Bailey is still extremely young and will grow early in his NBA career on that front, but doesn’t process the game at the speed we’d like him to yet.

This also sometimes results in poor shot selection as he’ll drive to the rim and get cut off, then forces a bad look.
Bailey wasn't the best 3-point shooter entering college, but shot nearly 40% from beyond the arc at UCLA. His mechanics look good and we think he can naturally continue to improve from beyond the arc with time.
What makes Bailey special is how he can also impact the defensive end. He plays with purpose and is disruptive on and off the ball. He’s a great point of attack defender that plays strong and can defend multiple positions.
Over the past several years, Bailey has played at Sierra Canyon under the brightest of lights. Not only has he played alongside Bronny James, but also guys like Ramel Lloyd (Nebraska), Brandon Boston Jr. (LA Clippers) and Ziaire Williams (Memphis Grizzlies).

Bailey was one of the biggest recruits UCLA has landed in recent history. He had high expectations on a team that should be really good. He played alongside five-star freshman Adem Bona last season as they both pursued a future to the NBA."

Strengths:
High basketball I.Q big … Good size for a forward/center … Solid length (measured with a 7-2 wingspan) and standing reach (9 feet, 3 inches) … Has better mobility and agility than most people think for a player of his size and body profile … Great feel for the game … Runs the floor well for a big … Versatile, can be used in either frontcourt position on offense …The definition of  a Stretch Big … Very good shooter in Spot Up actions … Has good hands … Has shown potential in Pick and Pop actions … Can be a rare case of a player who can either roll to the basket after a pick, or Pop Out … Good at doing a Short Roll after setting a pick, has quick decisions and can either shoot, make a drive or pass to the perimeter … Willing screener, with good hip mobility, can do a nice screen away from the ball and then turn and re-screen to set a quick Pick and Roll … Good at attacking closeouts, can make one or two dribbles and go to the basket … Has even scored some off the dribble shots … Moves well without the ball and makes smart cuts to the basket … Has good footwork in the post and can turn from either shoulder … Already has a turnaround one leg fade away shot in his arsenal that he uses often when he is posting up… Can punish some mismatches by facing up and shooting over his opponent … A good passer either from low post or the high post … Has shown some flashes playing flat in pick and roll actions … Knows the law of verticality when contesting a shot …
Weaknesses:
An average athlete by NBA standards … Needs to bulk up … Upper body has to fill out … Not afraid of contact, but has problems against physical, more athletic opponents … Has an inconsistent motor, doesn’t always look hungry … Not a great leaper … Kind of tweener, not fast or athletic enough to play as a power forward and not strong, or mobile enough to play as a center at the NBA level … Ball handling needs some polishing if he wants to play as a power forward … Lacks reps, he has been part of established, veteran teams for years and didn’t receive enough playing time to fully develop … Doesn’t draw many fouls … Doesn’t have the core strength to force his way to the basket in post ups against miss-matches … Has a tendency to settle when Posting Up and fall in love with his turnaround fade away, which is not a high percentage shot, at least for now … Has problems finishing through traffic or against contact … Average rebounder for his position, does good box outs, but doesn’t always go after the ball … Can lose focus on defense and miss some rotations… Bigger opponents can bully him in the Post… He is foul prone … Doesn’t always have the right defensive stance … Average lateral quickness, can’t really support switch defense … Not a rim protector, he is not a good enough leaper to do anything more than just contest a shot at the rim …
Outlook:
Tristan Vukcevic is a new era big … A skilled forward/center, with great feel for the game and a high basketball I.Q … Shooting is Vukcevic’s calling card and the thing that intrigues the most, since 7 footers with 3-point range are a rarity … At the same time though, he is projected to have a lot of problems on the defensive end due to his athletic limitations and thin frame … There is always room for a Stretch Big in the NBA, but for him to take the next step, he has to prove he can at least occasionally hold his ground on defense …

Stefanos Makris 6/19/23  The son of Serbia and Montenegro national team member Dusan Vukcevic, Tristan Vukcevic cracked Real Madrid's rotation last month immediately after turning 18 years old and has delivered several memorable performances since. He played crunch-time minutes in a key win over Barcelona and helped to ice the game with an important 3-pointer and a blocked shot. Standing 6-foot-11, Vukcevic is an outstanding shooter who has converted half of his attempts from beyond the arc this season, showing impressive confidence for a player his age. His long arms and solidly built frame allow him to see minutes at center in the ACB. Still, there are question he'll have to answer defensively when projecting to the NBA. He'll have to show he can move his feet and cover ground a little better than what we've seen thus far. Regardless, a high school senior-aged player seeing rotation minutes for a team this level is notable and will make him worth monitoring closely next season. -- Jonathan Givony

Vukcevic was somewhat inconsistent last season, as his playing time oscillated wildly between starter-level minutes and garbage time appearances. However, he's shown flashes of a prospect with an extremely high ceiling several times. 
Where we have seen the most consistency is on offense, as he's proven he can make an impact on day one at the NBA level on that end. Not only does he have the confidence to be a volume 3-point shooting big, but he also converts at a respectable rate. Combine the floor spacing with his touch and footwork, and it's easy to envision Vukcevic's game transferring at the next level. 
With his size, he can also space the floor vertically as a lob threat, especially in transition. Outside of being a shooter, it's been promising to see him score in a variety of ways as he matures. He has a solid bag of moves in the mid-range and loves to exploit smaller defenders. 
In the modern NBA, he's got the skillset that fits perfectly. Especially after playing against adults for the past few years, Vukcevic's transition to the NBA might be more smooth than some expect.
With that in mind, he doesn't offer much as a rim protector even at 6-foot-10. At this point, he's truly more of an offensive prospect that can be valuable at the NBA level as a stretch big with above average ball-handling ability for his size. The defense may take some time to come around at the NBA level.
As such, it's hard to imagine a world in which he can play center full-time upon being drafted. In certain scenarios it would make a lot of sense, but he's more of a stretch four. We have seen him have success alongside a traditional big this season, which is promising. As of today, he fouls quite a bit as he struggles to defend stronger traditional centers that live in the post. 

Vuckcevic’s combination of size and shooting ability is extremely enticing as a potential floor-spacer and rebounder at the next level. For now, he appears to be well on a solid path to get his name called at some point during the second round of the 2023 NBA Draft. However, he's got the potential to even end up being a late first rounder with a good pre-draft process."

Weaknesses:
Most of his deficiencies stem from his lack of strength and shooting … Needs to bulk up considerably to play at the next level … Struggles with inconsistency on the offensive end … Needs the ball in his hands to be effective … At times he can be too stationary, he should look to stay more active to get better looks… Has problems finishing at the rim through contact due to his thin frame … Ball handling can be loose and needs some polishing … Due to strength issues, still struggles in creating his own shot … Pull up game is inconsistent … Has a high shooting release point that lacks consistency … Has a tendency to take some questionable shots … Doesn’t draw enough fouls … Can improve from the line at 71% … Below average 3-point shooter, despite his good shooting mechanics, needs work in Spot Up  …  As a below average shooter, it is hard for him to attack closeouts, since opponents play off of him … Decision making is not there yet, still needs work in PnR actions … He should add some hesitation moves to his arsenal … Has problems against physical defense due to his average ball handling and thin frame … Doesn’t have a Post Game, he can’t really punish miss-matches… Average rebounder … Takes gambles on defense, which can lead to defensive breakdowns … He can be over aggressive at times on defense and commit unnecessary fouls … Not an NBA ready player, likely will require patience to realize his potential …
Overall:
Has the elite length (7-3 wingspan) that the NBA covets greatly and have shown a willingness to draft on upside … Will look to become the second French prospect (Ousmane Dieng) in as many years to be taken in the lottery following a one year stint in Australia … Rupert is an athletic guard/forward with great size … He is already a very good defender and has the potential to become a two-way player if his offensive game comes along at some point … He has shown promise as a secondary playmaker, but his offensive game needs a lot of work at this point … His ceiling will undoubtedly be determined by his offensive progress … If he manages to improve as a shooter, then he could become a prototypical 3-and-D player, if not, then he will have to settle as a defensive specialist and find other ways to be effective on the floor …
Notes:
Possesses a 7-3 wingspan … Native of Strasbourg, France … Comes from an athletic, basketball family … Sister Iliana Rupert plays in the WNBA for the Atlanta Dream … Father Thierry Rupert was a former power forward on the French National Team … Measured 6′ 6.00” barefoot, 8′ 10.00” standing reach, 193.2 lbs and a 7′ 2.00” wingspan and a 27.5 inch standing vertical and a 32.5′ inch max vertical at the 2023 NBA Draft Combine …
Stefanos Makris 4/3/23  A right wrist fracture caused Rupert to miss two months of action, but he made his return at the beginning of January. He quickly reclaimed his spot in the starting five, having some of his best games of the season recently as the New Zealand Breakers finished their season on a winning streak to claim second place and home-court advantage in the playoffs until the Finals. Rupert seems to have used his time off wisely as he's come back looking far more polished utilizing his left hand and has shown increasing flashes of shot-creation prowess and willingness to attack the rim aggressively looking for contact. Rupert's numbers don't jump off the page, but his maturity on both ends of the floor certainly does. Despite not turning 19 until the end of May, he brings a calming presence to his team's offense with his strong feel for the game and unselfish style, as well as strong defensive versatility and intensity required to play a key role for the NBL's most efficient defense.  Rupert's 7-3 wingspan allows him to make a huge impact off the ball, rotating to protect the rim, contesting shots on the perimeter and coming up with plenty of deflections and steals. He's often utilized as a point-of-attack defender, heating up the opposing team's point guard the length of the floor and has little issues switching onto bigger players due to his length, intensity and competitiveness. Every team in the NBA is looking for long-armed wings in Rupert's mold who can defend multiple positions, make good decisions with the ball and switch seamlessly from point guards to power forwards. Rupert's frame needs to continue to fill out, but he's already made significant strides in that department and has the type of shoulders and build that should be able to carry significant weight in the coming years. The next step for Rupert will be to find more consistency from the perimeter, where he's shown flashes of shot-making both off the dribble and with his feet set, but is only making 24% of his 3-pointers. His strong shooting mechanics and the rave reviews he draws off the court for his work ethic and overall approach bode well for his ability to improve here, but it will be difficult for him to reach his full potential until he becomes a more formidable scoring threat.  The fact that Rupert has been a key cog for a championship-contending team, something none of his NBL Next Star predecessors such as Josh Giddey, LaMelo Ball or Ousmane Dieng can boast, is clearly a feather in his cap. A huge number of NBA teams have already traveled to New Zealand to scout him in practices and games with more expected to arrive as his team's playoff campaign kicks off later in February. -- Jonathan Givony
 A French prospect, Rupert has the ability to play guard or wing. He stands at 6-foot-7 with a 7-3 wingspan, which is tremendous length. He’s also one of the younger prospects in this upcoming class, as he won’t turn 19 until right before the 2023 NBA Draft.
Like many young players, Rupert’s shot is a work in progress. He’s a solid free throw shooter which is a good sign, but his shot doesn’t fall at an efficient rate from beyond the arc. His jumper is smooth and has a high release point, but the ball dips a bit too much and it takes Rupert to long to get the shot off.
He’s improved as a rhythm shooter, but overall the shot selection can be poor at times for Rupert.
As a driver, the French prospect is crafty and has the ability to finish well with both hands. With that in mind, he does struggle with contact and physicality in the paint. An emphasis for him moving forward will be to gain weight and get stronger. He doesn’t have a ton of elite dribble moves or the quickest first step, but still finds ways to get to the rim.
One area of improvement we’ve seen from Rupert over the past two years is actually in the pick-and-roll. He’s certainly not a major creator of offense, but has gotten much better as the handler in those situations. Again, Rupert isn’t known for being a great facilitator but has shown flashes and generates decent assist numbers.
Rupert does move well without the ball, which does help generate solid looks.
One thing we think he can improve is rebounding efficiency. Given his size and length, Rupert should be pulling down more boards.
Overall, the French phenom projects to be an excellent defender at the next level. He’s got shot blocking upside and already is disruptive in passing lanes. He generates a ton of steals with his massive wingspan and has natural feel on that end of the floor. One thing that sticks out about Rupert is his ability to defend the point of attack at a high level.
With that in mind, there’s still plenty of room to improve. He’s sometimes undisciplined as a defender and gets too aggressive, which results in a foul or a defensive breakdown. He’s known for gambling a bit too much.
Either way, Rupert truly has the upside to be an impactful two-way player if the shot comes around. He’s part of the NBL’s Next Stars program that’s produced several first-round draft picks in recent years including Josh Giddey and Ousmane Dieng of late. The 18-year-old played with the New Zealand Breakers this season, where he had a somewhat inconsistent campaign due to injuries. 
Rupert previously attended the prestigious INSEP Academy in France has been on the NBA radar for some time now. He had at least seven NBA teams scout him in September during the NBL Blitz event.
Basketball is in Rupert’s genes. His sister, Iliana Rupert was the No. 12 overall pick in the 2021 WNBA Draft and his father played in the EuroLeague and was captain of the French National team."

NBA Comparison: Mardy Collins
Strengths:
Possesses a filled-out, physical frame and a powerful lower body … Background as a point growing up explains his great versatility and advanced guard skills … Strong defender who reads passing lanes well and creates turnovers … Plays with great pace,  body control, especially when he’s attacking toward the basket. One of the best playmaking wings in the 2023 NBA Draft class …. Comfortable bringing the ball up the floor and creating shots from the wing ,,. Utilizes long strides and extreme strength to get where he wants attacking the basket … Has some flair dishing the ball in traffic to his bigs under the basket … Long, physical defenders don’t deter him at any level … Smooth euro-step and aforementioned body control allow him to score and pass on the move in the middle of the floor … Elite poise in the air. Will hang up in the air, wait for passing lanes to open and execute accurate passes in tight windows … Averaged a steal and a block per game in 28 games with the G-League Ignite this season … Produced against high-level competition on both ends of the floor … Can spread the floor as an off-ball shooter. Showed some development in his perimeter jumper, even if it’s still inconsistent … Only turned 19 in April … Lockdown defender who can take on the best athletes on opposing teams … Solid lateral quickness keeps opponents in front of him … Closes out on the perimeter with speed and control, contesting outside shooters as well as any wing in the draft … Proved NBA readiness as a 13-point per game scorer with over three assists per game against professional competition … High potential with outstanding defensive impact, impressive playmaking and developing 3-point jumper at a young age … Good size for a wing with a 6’10 wingpsan and 8’8 standing reach …
Weaknesses:
While his 3-point jumper steadily improved throughout the season, it’s still nowhere near a strength to his game … Failed to make a 3-pointer in 19 of his 43 total games with the G-League Ignite … Lacks ideal speed for a wing … Despite being an tenacious defender, foot speed could cap his potential as an on ball defender … Shot just 64% from the free-throw line this season, which doesn’t bode well in conjunction with his 3-point struggles for much of the season … Struggled to stay on the floor at times with over three fouls per game. Rotational rookies like Cissoko need to stay out of foul trouble to earn minutes early in their career … A player with his size and strength shouldn’t post the low rebounding numbers that he put up (2.8 per game) … Not a high-level athlete, posting just a 30.5 standing vertical and 35.5 max vertical leap, which ranked just inside the top-30 at the combine … Relies more on strength than speed/quickness … Could struggle to beat NBA defenders off the dribble without an elite first step or a deep bag of ball-handling moves … Failure to win off the bounce will result in Cissoko’s only immediate offensive strengths being limited at the next level … Will need to improve his 3-point range quickly in order to take advantage of closeouts and keep defenders honest to help him get downhill …
Notes:
Measured 6’5.5 barefoot, 8’8” standing reach, 223.8 lbs and a 6’9.75” wingspan at the 2023 NBA Draft Combine. Posted a 30.5 inch standing vertical and a 35.5 inch max vertical at the 2020 NBA Draft Combine … First European-born prospect to join the G-League Ignite … Born in Saint-Maurice, France … Played for France at 2021 FIBA U18 European Challengers and 2022 FIBA U18 European Championship … Played for World Select Team in the 2022 Nike Hoop Summit …
Derek Bast 6/19/23  Cissoko did a little bit of everything for France, averaging 21.4 points, 9.2 rebounds, 6.0 assists and 4.6 steals per 40 minutes. He was a menace by jumping passing lanes and getting anywhere he wanted operating in the open floor. He also used his powerful frame to bounce off opponents, finish through contact and live at the free throw line.

Although his handle isn't very advanced and he can be inconsistent with his decision-making, Cissoko proved capable of dishing on the move and making touch passes to teammates in stride for easy baskets, using both hands as a passer and demonstrating nice creativity and vision overall. While streaky, he was able to step into 3-pointers and knock down open jumpers effectively, even demonstrating some potential shooting off movement with strong mechanics. And at 6-foot-7 with a huge frame, Cissoko showed the potential to defend a variety of positions as well as some instincts in making smart rotations to protect the rim and generate turnovers all tournament.

At times a little casual with his approach, cutting down on turnovers and showing better focus with his awareness and technique off the ball will be important for Cissoko to shore up his role-playing credentials with G League Ignite next season. He gets beat off the dribble more than you'd like, gambles excessively for steals and will do some head-scratching things with the ball, leading to ill-advised shots or turnovers. While his jumper looks good coming out of his hand, he only made 25% of his attempts, similar to his LEB Gold stats this past season. Cissoko converting 78% of his free throws is encouraging, but teams will want to see him demonstrate better touch as a finisher around the basket, where he lacks a degree of explosiveness.

France will surely be disappointed with their fifth-place finish, but there was plenty to be encouraged about regarding Cissoko's performance. He'll likely be more effective with better spacing principles and coaching in the G League than what he saw at this event.  One of the younger prospects in this upcoming class, Cissoko is a French guard with intriguing tools. The offensive upside isn’t there quite yet consistently, but his defensive ability pops.
On the offensive end, the jumbo guard is best at attacking the rim. He doesn’t have the quickest first step, so he relies on using his strength. One thing Cissoko could improve on to combat the lack of elite quickness is ball handling. If he can tighten the handle and overall generate better looks off the bounce, he’d be much improved.
While Cissoko can play on the ball as the primary facilitator, he spent most of the season off-ball in the G League given he played next to Scoot Henderson. This worked well, especially since he moves so well without the ball in the flow of the offense.
His positional size is great, which allows him to play anything from point guard to point forward. Overall, Cissoko is an extremely smart player that makes those around him more effective. He plays with energy and effort, doing small fundamental things that don't show up on the box score.
His 3-point shot is still developing, which is something scouts will be keeping an eye on. It got better as the year went on, and while the numbers still aren't anywhere near an elite level, his shot is promising. The French guard is often too passive on the offensive end, needing to be more assertive and confident. The Ignite prospect is also a good passer, using his height to see over defenders and find his teammates. He has legitimate lead guard skills which makes him even more impactful. 
Cissoko’s combination of length and strength helps tremendously on defense. He’s got a very strong lower body and moves well laterally. This allows him to defend a wide variety of positions, including bigger wings. The French guard is disciplined as a defender and has gotten better about avoiding foul calls.

As a draft prospect, offense will be the swing factor. Late in the G League season, he did have several great performances in which he scored the ball at a high level. However, it didn't happen frequently enough to feel fully confident he could do that at the next level."

Jackson is a hybrid forward with very good size, especially for the perimeter as a 6’9 215 player who already has a strong, mature build and the frame to become even more imposing with time … Excellent length with a 7-foot wingspan … Very good run-jump athleticism; covers ground in a hurry as a rangy strider and has proven to be a powerful leaper, especially with momentum going downhill … Intriguing scoring repertoire (15 ppg as a Fr.); has the raw ability to put the ball in the basket at all 3 levels and can make some highly impressive shots when creating offense for himself … Aggressive and isn’t shy about putting constant pressure on the defense with the rock in his hands, whether iso ball or in the pick and roll game … Strong 1st step … Pretty decent ball-handling skills and shows the ability to change up rhythm with hesitation dribbles to keep his man off balance … Impressive footwork allows him to stop suddenly to rise into pull-up jumpers or utilize up-and-unders when defenders play him too aggressively in one direction … Nice groundwork for occasional back-to-basket production; will utilize turnaround jumpers and jump hooks against smaller match ups in the low or mid post areas & played extended time on the low block in HS/AAU..Full of moves and can string together flashy combination dribbles to free himself up from defenders … Has range that extends past the NBA 3 and poses a threat hitting shots off the dribble or with his feet set … Will generally make well-timed cuts or relocate to open spots when playing off the ball … Had some impressive defensive flashes denying penetration and smothering shooters when locked in (26 blocks in 32 games), physically won’t have many problems matching up with NBA 3s and 4s … Willing rebounder at the college level (6 rpg) and will look to initiate transition offense after missed shots … Could greatly benefit from being around more talented teammates and not having to shoulder such a considerable load at the next level like he did at South Carolina … Youngest prospect in the 2023 Draft class after reclassifying to the 2022 HS class; would turn 19 years old about a month into his rookie season …
Weaknesses:
Maturity remains his biggest hurdle … For as talented as Jackson is, his lack of efficiency this past season was very concerning (38 FG%, 32 3FG%, 42 FG% inside the arc) … His shot selection was poor, too often wasting possessions playing hero ball and dribbling the air out of the rock … Took numerous shots early into the shot clock before his teammates could ever touch the ball, leading many to label him a ‘ballhog’ … Averaged less than 1 assist per game as a Freshman, and generally shows little to no court vision or feel for making teammates better … Too often either didn’t have a plan or had obvious pre-determined reads with the ball that were easy for the defense to take advantage of … Has a tendency to dribble with his head down and often was swarmed by defenders and forced into turnovers/offensive fouls (2.7 topg) … Sometimes you can tell that he’s new to playing extended time on the perimeter based on how he reacts to ball pressure and scramble defenses … Was not a devoted defensive player as a freshman; gave up a ton of open shots due to lax effort and often seemed unfamiliar with scouting reports and matchup tendencies … The high center of gravity he plays with and his tendency to ball watch also didn’t do him any favors on that end, particularly as a helpside defender … His focus, effort and body language both during games and on the sidelines were concerning at various points of the season, and despite his age there will be teams that keep in mind how he acts when the going gets tough for him …
Overall:
GG Jackson was a very highly regarded 5-star recruit from Columbia, SC who reclassified from 2023 HS class, where he was seen as the top recruit by many recruiting sites, to the 2022 class and decided to play close to home at South Carolina after previously being committed to UNC … He basically was, for better or worse, handed the keys to the program as a 17 year old freshman by new coach Lamont Paris and led the team in scoring in his 1st season on a struggling South Carolina team that finished 11-21 in 22-23 … Jackson showed his raw ability to light up the scoreboard (15.4 ppg, 2nd among SEC Fr. behind potential lottery pick Brandon Miller of Alabama) that made him such a highly sought after recruit, but he also went through a tough adjustment to college as a younger than usual 1st year player … He wasn’t very efficient, but what was even more worrisome is that he at times sulked when he didn’t get the ball, let one mistake compound to another, and even took to Instagram live to publicly complain about not getting the ball late in a close conference loss to Arkansas … Some of his struggle to adjust may be due to growing pains going from primarily being a post player in HS/AAU to more perimeter-oriented in college, but regardless he seemed to more often than not be going through the motions as a young Fr … As a prospect Jackson has big upside, particularly scoring the ball offensively, and he seems to have no problem showing it … There is a thin line between confidence and arrogant me and some of the shots and possessions Jackson had this past season straddled the line maybe too closely, but there are plenty teams who would rather their players be aggressive than passive … He may be able to trust his pro teammates more, which would be best for him and his teammates in the future … He’s arguably the most polarizing prospect in this class, but if he’s selected in the right situation some team could be rewarded for their patience and diligence and have a great value pick on their roster … GG Jackson certinly qualifies as a player that could fail to “make it” with his first team. The upside is incredible, but his situational dependence may be higher than any player in this year’s draft …

Jorrye Nixon 5/23/23
Strengths:
6’9 versatile big man … Good body frame that will have no issue filling out … Great mobility, long strides, and high-level athlete. Consistently runs the floor and quick, beating others up the floor. Moves well and very light on his feet for his size. Finishes above the rim with ease and quick off the ground, doesn’t need to gather before leaping. Good body control and can jump off either foot. Well balanced and under control … Very good ball-handler and smooth/shifty for his size. Has the rare ability to not only put it on the floor, but breaks down the defense, shakes his defender, and slashes to the rim off the dribble while not relying on triple threat. Also possesses rare iso offensive ability and capability to get downhill for his size and age. Quick step, changes speed and direction well with the ball. Effective crossover. Doesn’t over-dribble or dance with his defender … Can score inside and out. Has a nice jump hook and fadeaway going over either shoulder, doesn’t hesitate to use either hand around the basket, showing good touch … Solid 3PT shooting ability, stretching the floor at a respectable clip, but unlike many prospects his age, he doesn’t drift to the perimeter too often showing a good balance of playing both inside and out. Shoots well from midrange, pulling up off the dribble and out of crossovers going into his shot after getting the defenders on their heels that you don’t see often from players at any size at his age … Scoring averages: 9.2 PPG 64.5% (4th best) FG% NBPA Top 100 2021, 14 PPG 64.7% FG% (4th best) U18 Americas Championship 2022, 13.6 PPG NBPA Top 100 2022, 12.8 PPG 48.4% FG% Nike EYBL 2022 … Solid passing ability.

Averaged 1.5 blocks per game at the U18 Americas Championship and 1.9 blocks per game over the Nike EYBL in 2022 … Younger for his class, won’t turn 18 until December of his freshman year of college …
Weaknesses:
Doesn’t have a great length relative to height with a 6’10 wingspan … Still has room to add strength, but as mentioned earlier, has a strong frame and is projected to fill out in time as he’s still only 17 years old … Still has room to expand post-game as he won’t be able to rely on superior tools at the next levels as much. Getting to his spots and finishing may take some time adjusting … While respectable and the foundation is there, he still has room to improve 3PT consistency. 3PT shooting: 25% 3PT% on 1.6 3PT attempts per game at the NBPA Top 100 and 34.2% 3PT% on 1.9 3PT attempts per game over the Nike EYBL 2022 … Can improve as a free throw shooter. Shot 57.1% FT% at the NBPA Top 100 and 56.6% FT% Nike EYBL in 2022 … Averaged 1.9 assists to 1.9 turnovers per game over the Nike EYBL in 2022 …
Outlook:

Evan Tomes 8/12/22  Jackson clearly wasn't ready to be a featured option as a just-turned-18-year-old in the SEC, shooting an abysmal 38% from 2-point range and 29% from 3 with nearly three times as many turnovers as assists in conference play. NBA teams say he's one of the more difficult evaluations they've seen in recent years, as it has been difficult to stay optimistic about his long-term outlook considering the poor decision-making, defense and production he has displayed for much of the season.

Even more alarming has been the way Jackson has responded to his own struggles, be it calling out his coaching staff on social media from the locker room or displaying poor body language on the sidelines on multiple occasions, indicating a distinct lack of maturity. Jackson has gone from being the No. 1 recruit in his high school class to no sure thing as far as hearing his name called in the first round, meaning he has a significant amount of work ahead of him during the pre-draft process to alleviate the concerns around him if he indeed elects to enter the NBA draft. -- Jonathan Givony  One of the youngest prospects in this upcoming class, Jackson was still 17 at the start of the college season and will be 18 on the night of the 2023 NBA Draft. As a rookie, he won’t turn 19 until two months into the 2023-24 NBA season.
A highly skilled power forward, Jackson was the No. 1 high school player in the 2023 class before reclassifying into the 2022 class.
On the offensive end, Jackson is more of a modern forward. He lacks a true post game, but is still very effective as a scorer. Especially in the modern NBA, that shouldn’t hold him back. He loves the turnaround fadeaway in the midrange and is starting to become a more reliable 3-point shooter.
Jackson definitely isn’t an elite shooter from deep, but is reliable when open and has time to get his shot off. He has a smooth jumper, so there shouldn't be any concerns longer term about his perimeter scoring. Where he really thrives is in transition where likes to pull the rebound off the rim and run with it. He’s light on his feet and moves well for a guy of his size.
As an isolation scorer, the South Carolina freshman is special. He’s got a great handle and can generate his own shot. With the NBA becoming so heavy in isolation situations, his game should translate well at the next level. Not many guys his size are legitimate playmakers. With that in mind, he did struggle quite a bit at the college level and often took bad shots. Playing at the college level at the age of a high school senior is no easy task, so it's fair that he had some issues adjusting on and off the court. Regardless, the incredible upside and ceiling was very clear despite the inefficiency and questionable decision making.
Overall, Jackson reads the game well and has good natural feel. His solid footwork translates on both ends, especially on defense. While he does lack length as it relates to wingspan, the combination of quick feet and strength allows him to defend multiple positions.
The young forward’s size and skillset is ideal for modern NBA and he’s still so young that there’s optimism he’ll only get better over the next few years at a rapid rate. 
The former five-star prospect is the highest recruit the Gamecocks had ever landed. As a junior at Ridge View High School he earned South Carolina’s Gatorade Player of the Year. Prior to committing to play for the Gamecocks, Jackson was originally set to attend North Carolina but backed out.
Given how young he is, Jackson is definitely a guy that could really improve his draft stock by coming back another season, but is still very worthy of an early selection in the 2023 NBA Draft. However, there's a real chance he could be a top five pick in next summer's class if he opted to go that route."

NBA Comparison: Dillon Brooks
Strengths:
6’ 5” 214 lbs wing that has a strong frame and is one of the draft’s best 3 point shooters … Great off ball scorer that excels shooting from deep … Does most of his damage coming off of screens and spotting up … Usually pretty consistent shooter (shot 40% from three this year) but also has the ability to get red hot and score in bunches … Makes it really hard for defenders to help off of him because any room he is given to shoot he will take … Smooth shot with a high release … Gets feet set quickly … Shows range out to NBA three point … Automatic from distance if left open, an attribute that should give him a defined role at the next level if his defense holds up … Rebounds well and has the size and frame to continue that in the NBA (AVG 6.3 RPG as a senior) … Above average defender who has proven he can guard multiple positions in college … Better perimeter defender than interior but can hold his own inside … A sneaky athlete with great length with a +6 inch wingspan over height … 35.5 inch max vert surprised some as he doesn’t necessarily always “play athletic” … Unorthodox body with long arms and broad shoulders …. Length and quick shot allows him to get shots off without a great deal of sunlight … Mature, headstrong player with excellent leadership ability …
Weaknesses:
Lacks ideal fluidity, speed and athleticism … Doesn’t create his own shots as often as you would like from a scorer … Outside of catch and shoot, his offensive repertoire is somewhat limited and predictable as he generally will try to create space with a one dribble, step back pull up … Lacks an elite first step which makes it hard to beat defenders off the dribble and create separation in ISO … Will only attack the rim if he has a clear path or mismatch … When he gets the ball it’s usually a shot or give the ball up quickly… Not much of a passer (Career 0.7 APG in 4 years at PSU) … Despite being a strong free throw shooter (80.7 FT%) he rarely gets to the line. Should look to create more contact, although a lot of that is due to him being more of a spot up scorer than an initiator  … Has a tendency to force shots while off balance … Not a standout athlete, though he can get off the floor when he gets his feet under him  … A bit of a two foot jumper that lacks great vertical on a sprint … Struggles to defend against players stronger than him … Turned 23 on April 2nd, making him one of the draft’s older prospects …
Overall:
Lundy came to Penn State during Lamar Stevens senior year and many people expected him to be the heir to one of the programs all-time greats due to their similar builds and playing styles. During his freshman season he did play a little more like Stevens and was more aggressive and willing to drive. As he developed though he turned into more of a shooter and relied more on the three pointer than his inside game. By his senior season he was no doubt a different player than Stevens. He took 62% of his shots behind the three point line this season. He’s got good size and a long wingspan and with his shooting ability he could be a solid 3 and D role player of the bench in the NBA.
Notes:
Measured: 6′ 4.00” barefoot, 8′ 8.00” standing reach, 214.4 lbs, 6′ 10.25” wingspan, and a 35.5 inch maximum vertical … Four year starter at Penn State … Starred at Roman Catholic in Philadelphia, PA …
Jacob Roth 6/10/23  A versatile hybrid prospect that can play anything from off-ball guard to forward, Lundy should get real consideration in the 2023 NBA Draft. He isn’t the most flashy player and his stats don’t jump off the page, but the Big Ten star does nearly everything and impacts winning at a high level. He projects to be a clear role player in the NBA with good size at 6-foot-6.
Lundy isn’t the most athletic, but is built well at 220 pounds. He’s a very smart player and uses that to his advantage. He’s a good positional rebounder and has increased his scoring output in each out his four college seasons. The first two jumps were due to an increased role and more shots, but the leap in his senior season was more due to efficiency. He increased his points per game while taking same amount of shots, as his efficiency went through the roof, shooting 45% from floor including 40% from deep and converting on 80% of his shots from the line. He also generated free free throws per game, which is a very translatable skill.
What’s most impressive about Lundy is his smooth jumper. Both in the midrange and from beyond the arc, he should have no problem scoring points outside of the paint at the next level. With that in mind, he generally needs to be created for. He’s also not the best at creating for others, as he produced more turnovers than assists in his college career.
For Lundy to have success at the next level, it’s all about defense and the 3-point shot. If he can stretch the floor and be versatile with the types of players he can guard, he should be able to earn NBA minutes off the bench at some point. Especially if he can make the most of his time on the court and produce efficiently like we saw last season, he’ll find his place.

The former three-star recruit is from Pennsylvania and stayed in-state for his four seasons at Penn State. He has always been a tough player that’s willing to do whatever it takes to help his team win games."

Weaknesses:
Not an elite athlete… Needs a lot of work as a facilitator… Ball handling needs polishing if he wants to be able to slide down to point guard and be more versatile… A below average Pull Up shooter for now, despite his clean jumper… Decision making needs a lot of work… Prone to commit turnovers… More of a streaky shooter in Spot Ups, especially in above the break 3s… Has problems creating his own shot from stand still against athletic players… An average finisher at the rim… Has problems finishing through contact at the rim… Struggles to finish plays in the paint in traffic… Not really creative when attacking the basket… Finishing with his left hand needs work… Doesn’t really draw a lot of fouls despite his good body… Can’t create for his teammates… Average passer, more of a finisher… Bad assist/turnover ratio… Needs a lot of work in Pick and Roll actions as the ball handler… Not really a threat in Pick and Roll actions, he has never been asked to be a facilitator… He should add a floater to his game to have a counter move when attacking the basket… Suffers from tunnel vision when he drives to the basket… At times he doesn’t have a low defensive stance and gets blown by… Occasionaly loses focus on defense… Takes some risks defensively… He should add some muscle to be able to guard bigger wings
Overall:
Mojave King projects to be a solid 3-and-D… He has shown a lot of promise as a shooter in Spot Up 3s (especially from the corners), knows how to move without the ball and is already a good defender… At the same time though he is still more of a streaky 3-point shooter, he is surprisingly inefficient in transition and needs work as a facilitator… If he manages to become at least a 38% 3-point shooter then everything will change. If not, then it will be really difficult for him to find a role in the NBA
Notes:
Measured 6′ 3.75” barefoot, 8′ 5.00” standing reach, 200.6 lbs and a 6′ 8.00” wingspan and a 33.5 inch standing vertical and a 42′ inch max vertical at the 2023 NBA Draft Combine …
Stefanos Makris  A smooth, 6-foot-5 off-guard with a strong frame, good athleticism and versatility, Mojave King proved to be the tournament's best perimeter shooter, knocking down 14 of his 29 3-point attempts in just more than 100 minutes of action.

King historically has been happy to defer to others, but his ability to score in the open floor, hit clean jumpers, get teammates involved and make the right play is interesting, considering his youth and physical tools. The next step in his development will be for him to play with more aggressiveness on both ends of the floor and become a more dynamic ball handler. -- Jonathan Givony  The pre-season hype for G League Ignite ahead of the 2022-23 season was through the roof, as the team had not only the best NBA prospect playing in America in Scoot Henderson, but also a number of players in Efe Abogidi, Leonard Miller and Sidy Cissoko who were expected to solidify their cases as NBA prospects. Mojave King didn’t come to Ignite with the same level of hype, but as the G League Ignite season progressed, he has seen his draft stock rise.
Before joining the G League, the New Zealand born prospect played for quite some time professionally. After consistently standing out at youth competitions in Australia during his teenage years, King joined the NBA Global Academy in January of 2019. The then 16-year-old King, found himself in the spotlight as a part of one of the most stacked youth teams international basketball has seen during the past decade, on a roster that included three future NBA Players in Dyson Daniels, Josh Giddey and Bennedict Mathurin, plus college standouts Taran Armstrong, Olivier-Maxence Prosper and Aly Khalifa. King left NBA Academy and signed with the Cairns Taipans instead of playing college ball in the US ahead of the 2020-21 Australian NBL season as part of the NBL Next Stars program, which has produced several early draft picks in recent years.
Things didn’t go smoothly for King in his rookie NBL season, as the potential 2021 NBA Draft prospect didn’t play much with Cairns but then switched teams to play with the Adelaide 36ers where he struggled to get playing time once again. From there, he signed with the Southland Sharks of the New Zealand NBL where he was able to receive big minutes and make an impact before joining the Ignite.
King is a versatile shooter who moves well off the ball and shoots an extremely repeatable jumper. His high release point and ability to prepare quickly makes it hard for opponents to contest his jumper. His effortless stroke is quick and fluid. King has also shown moments of shooting off the dribble, being able to do more than just knock down rhythm shots. The 3-point shooting efficiency at the G League level doesn't tell the whole story for the sharpshooter, who had an inconsistent shooting season.
King utilizes his shooting gravity to draw closeouts, which he attacks with a solid combination of speed and power. He doesn’t have the most fluid handle in terms of changing directions or creating space out of dribble moves alone, but he compensates with his quick first step and a number of pre-dribble moves. He also doesn’t process the game at an elite level, so he is better suited off-ball anyways rather than being a lead guard.
King also makes a strong impact defensively. At 6-foot-5 with a near 6-foot-8 wingspan, he uses his long arms, his strong frame and his ability to elevate from a standstill to contest and block shots at the rim, as well as to collaborate as a defensive rebounder. On the perimeter is where King makes most of his impact, having the optimal size and length to defend both guard positions. He plays with a lot of energy defensively and moves laterally extremely well, being able to keep opponents in front of him and contain dribble penetration.
The upside as a shooter is certainly there, especially for someone who just played an entire season with the extended NBA shooting distance. The combine and pre-draft workouts could be huge for King to prove he's better than his percentages would suggest.
A potential 3-and-D off-ball guard or wing at the NBA level, King is worth a second-round look. He has basketball in his genes, as his mom, dad and older sister each have experience playing high level hoops."

NBA Comparison: Derrick Brown
Strengths:
Tall, versatile guard who is brilliant attacking the basket to either side … Phenomenal positional rebounder who averaged over 6 per game playing small-ball four … Versatility on both ends of the floor is his calling guard … Shifty ball-handler who initiates and finishes through contact well, often earning trips to the foul line and scoring efficiently at the stripe (78% on 3.5 FTA per game) … Defends 1-3 but also has experience guarding 4s on the wing and should be able to have that translate with good size and athleticism … Excellent secondary ball-handler option who wins off the dribble and keeps his head up as a solid playmaker. Averaged nearly 3 assists per game without a high usage rate … Takes care of the ball masterfully, as he never averaged two or more turnovers per game in his five-year career … Experienced, savvy guard who can do it all offensively … Valuable addition to any rotation … 62% shooter from inside the arc
in two years at Miami …
Weaknesses:
One of the oldest players in the class at 23 years old (will turn 24 in January) … Not an elite shooter, although he is comfortable letting it fly to keep defenders honest … Measured in shorter than expected which could limit defensive versatility … Limited potential with older age and more of a role player skill set … Might not have the burst or skills to win as consistently and create shots for himself at the next level … A little lean, which will present problems handling larger wings or preventing post ups against larger players. He was able to get away with it against college competition, but could struggle in NBA play …
Notes:
Measured 6′ 4.50” barefoot, 8′ 7.50” standing reach, 191.6 lbs and a 6′ 11.75” wingspan and a 32 inch standing vertical and a 36.5′ inch max vertical at the 2023 NBA Draft Combine …
Derek Bast 6/22/23  Miller had his best college game Sunday, leading Miami to a 13-point second-half comeback over Texas to make the school's first Final Four appearance. He had 27 points on 7-for-7 shooting and went 13-for-13 from the free throw line.

Miami repeatedly cleared out the floor and asked Miller to take Timmy Allen, Christian Bishop and Brock Cunningham off the dribble one-on-one, something he did with great success to get to the rim and finish with his left hand.

When Texas responded by sending help, Miller showed off his passing mettle with nifty bounce passes out of pick-and-roll or a jump-pass kickout for an open 3-pointer.

Miller's performance was impressive, but it's difficult to see how translatable his game is to what his role would be in the NBA. Miller is a career 33% 3-point shooter on a pretty low volume of attempts throughout his five-year college career, sporting awkward lefty mechanics that might not translate to the NBA line. He has versatility mirroring smaller players on the perimeter and staying in front of guards, but doesn't have much size or bulk at 6-foot-7 and 195 pounds to seamlessly play as a big man, and likely at 23 years old doesn't have much more physical development in front of him.

Miller's solid feel for the game, intensity and productivity will get him looks in the pre-draft process, but he'll have to prove he can make perimeter shots at an acceptable rate to carve out a role for himself as a likely undrafted player.-- Jonathan Givony  After playing five seasons at the college level, Miller will look to make the jump to the NBA. Leading up to this point, he spent three seasons at George Mason followed by two at Miami. He earned an All-ACC Team nod last season in what was his best college campaign that concluded with a deep push in the NCAA Tournament.

As a prospect, Miller’s position is interesting. He’s 6-foot-7 and played quite a bit of guard at Miami, but might be better served as a wing in the NBA. He’s much better off-ball given he’s not a great self-creator, but can absolutely produce points in a secondary role. The swingman is highly effective inside the arc, converting on 62% of his 2-point attempts the past two seasons. He’s a really good slasher that can finish in traffic, through contact, and utilizes his size.
He saw a year-over-year increase in his role, making the most of it and rising to the occasion. Miller showed that he has the vision, feel, and IQ to set other teammates up as a tertiary playmaker. The swing skill is his jumper. It’s encouraging that he improved from deep last season, but it was on fairly low volume and he tends to pass up open looks from time to time.

Miller is a solid rebounder that has no problem leading the break. Those are traits that should translate well in the NBA as teams look to play fast and push in transition. He’s also an underrated passer, producing nearly three assists per game and notching five contests with at least five assists last season.
Defensively, Miller brings a lot to the table. He’s extremely versatile and can legitimately hold his own against four positions. Outside of centers, he’s proven that he is effective guarding both on the perimeter and in the paint against all other positions. He’s also great within a scheme and is a good team defender. Miller consistently makes the right rotations, in the help when needed, and it’s evident he pays attention to the scouting report on the opposing team.

A late riser due to his performance in the postseason, it’s no guarantee that Miller gets drafted. However, he’s showcased his versatility and seamless fit at the next level well enough to at least get consideration in the pre-draft process."

Bates is a thin 6’9 180 swingman with good height for the perimeter…An aggressive volume scorer through and through; truly a hired gun who likes to put points on the board (19.2 PPG in ‘22-23)…Does the majority of his damage shooting the ball on the perimeter (76 made 3s as a Soph.) and he can get shots off the dribble, spotting up and running to spots along the wing in transition and occasionally off screens too…Not afraid to let it fly and shows range beyond the NBA 3-point line (career 6.4 3FGA/G, nearly 8 3FGA/G as a Soph.)…Can stick pull-up shots from the mid-range when chased off the line…Will take tough shots against close contests and has enough height to make these shots over smaller defenders, but also can quicken his release against like-sized defenders…Had some monster scoring outbursts this past season that illustrated his ability to put up points in bunches; 4 games with 30+ points and 2 games with 8 or more made 3-pointers….Decent ball-handling skills for his height and in combination with his good body control has some moves to create some separation when he can’t initially beat defenders…Drew fouls and converted at the charity stripe at a solid rate this past season (5 FTA/G on 78 FT%)…OK contributions on the defensive glass from the perimeter (5.8 RPG as a Soph.)…Has been a highly scrutinized prospect for years and has dealt with his fair share of adversity, but he’s revitalized himself as a legitimate NBA prospect again, and it’s important to note that he’s still only 19 and wouldn’t turn 20 until months into the 2023-2024 NBA season
Weaknesses:
Athleticism is mediocre at best, particularly in terms of quickness and explosiveness…Nothing special as a leaper or in terms of his ability to run the floor either…Has a frail frame and a short wingspan; outside of height his physical tools arent especially great and he clearly needs time in a weight training program…Feast or famine shooter/scorer (33 3FG%); one-dimensional player who won’t contribute much if he isn’t making shots…Doesn’t have a quick 1st step; it’s concerning that he struggled mightily to get clean looks and beat defenders at the MAC level off the dribble…Below average finisher around the rim for a 6’9 player and he also doesn’t play through contact well, mostly looking to avoid it or take tougher shots off the dribble (47 FG% inside the arc)…Alot of hero ball and unacceptable shot selection when watching him play; doesnt really play a style that’s conducive to winning at the moment…Dances with the ball and settles for low percentage shots too much (40 FG% in ‘22-23)…A bit selfish and wants things his way; was often a black hole on offense and the long leash he had at East Michigan won’t translate to NBA basketball…Doesn’t pass the ball much and isn’t accurate or quick to read the defense when he does look to swing it (1.4:2.5 A:TO)…Too often was a liability on defense at the mid-major level, which is concerning considering the leap in talent and speed of the game at the pro level…Lack of length shows as he doesn’t make much impact in passing lanes or altering shots (0.5 BPG, 0.7 SPG)…Doesn’t hold up well against quickness at the point of attack on the perimeter, but also doesn’t have the strength to guard taller players along the frontcourt either…Fundamentals are suspect; high center of gravity he plays with is less than ideal both on and off the ball & make him susceptible to blow-bys and backdoors…Often out of position and was a main reason EMU was one of the worst defensive teams in college hoops last season in terms of giving up points…Effort when recovering after getting beat and when getting through screens both need improvement…Some improved production and flashes as a Soph., but is still considered by many to be an underachiever considering his HS/AAU hype…Has off-court concerns after a gun/drug related arrest just before last season, though charges were eventually dropped
Overall:
Emoni Bates has been a storied prospect from Michigan since the fall of 2018 when he was only a 9th grader, generating hype on the internet due to his top-notch volume scoring arsenal as a 6’8 14 year old…The hype only continued to grow for the next 3 years, when during that time he won a state title as a Fr. and was the Gatorade National POY as a Soph…After his Jr. season, Bates would reclassify to the 2021 HS Class after initially being a 2022 prospect and committed to stay close to home and play for Michigan State at first, before flipping to sign with Memphis months later just before the season…A consensus top 5 recruit, Bates was projected to be a one-and-done prospect and a favorite to be one of the first picks in the 2022 Draft but his time at Memphis was a disappointment relative to the hype; with him missing roughly half the season due to injuries, never seeming to get in rhythm, and adjusting slowly after being asked to play PG which was a new position for him…He struggled with his defense and overall efficiency his Fr. year and decided to transfer to Eastern Michigan, his hometown school, for a change of scenery…Only a month after returning home, Bates was arrested on felony gun charges that he pleaded out to in exchange for the charges being dropped…The arrest did not help him in his fight to reemerge on draft radars again, but he seemed to find some motivation and started the season off well and had some memorable performers against a few of the power conference schools on Eastern Michigan’s schedule that caught the attention of scouts again (including a 30-point performance in the season opener against Michigan & 36 points against fellow 2023 Draft prospect GG Jackson and South Carolina)…But he also showed the same struggles that he had at Memphis with his shaky shot selection, poor defense and selfish approach on a bad Eastern Michigan team that gave up easy shots left and right and was among the worst teams in the country…Bates definitely had a hand in the poor defense played and the fact that he couldn’t impact winning at mid-major school after being a blue chip recruit and also didn’t stand out athletically is discouraging to many…The silver lining is that he is still only 19 years old and that gives him plenty of time to figure things out and grow, but he has to buy in to a more team-centered approach (even if it’s as instant offense off the bench or a floor spacer) to be successful at the NBA level after it mostly being all about him over the past 5 years…Bates is mostly being projected as a late 2nd round pick and a team could take a chance on him based on his shot-making upside and HS pedigree…

Jorrye Nixon 6/14/23
Strengths:
6’9 forward … Big-time scoring ability and skill-set. Creates for himself in a variety of ways. Very good in isolation. Can create scoring from scratch but also knows how to score in the flow of the game. Doesn’t rely on triple-threat, can get where he wants with a live dribble. Defense struggles to stop him at times even if they know he’s taking the shot. Can score from anywhere on the floor with ability to get to the rim, midrange scoring, and shooting range out to the NBA 3PT line. Good touch on floater … Good shooter: hits shots off step-backs and pull-ups. Good form on shot with proper arc, rotation, and high release point. Goes into his shot well off an array of dribble moves. Shoots well on the move: coming off pin downs, curls, etc. … Isn’t afraid to play physical. Very good at drawing fouls and very reliable free throw shooter … Good athlete. Gets up with ease and attacks with aggression. Good finisher at the rim, especially in transition … Very good ball handler. Creates well with it and stays under control pushing it up the floor at a high speed. Changes speed and direction well with the ball. Drives to the basket going to both his left and right … Solid passing ability. Good at avoiding traps and double-teams to hit the open man. Good timing on lead passes and alley-oops … Good rebounder … Sticks to his man defensively and good shot blocker for position … Consistent effort and stays engaged. Doesn’t go through the motions or take plays off on either end … Skilled all-around and doesn’t lack fundamentals. Very aggressive mindset. Well-documented hard worker and big-time competitor …
Weaknesses:
Not bad size for a wing but length is the same as height with a 6’9 wingspan … Obviously young and has physically maturing yet to fulfill but has room to get stronger, which isn’t a long-term issue … Puts up some deep and contested shots at times … Very good competitor but can wear his emotions …
Outlook:
Michigan State commit … Playing for Ypsi Prep for his junior year … 2019 and 2020 Michigan Gatorade Player of the Year … 2020 National Gatorade Player of the Year …
Evan Tomes 12/12/20  Bates wasn't able to get Eastern Michigan into the MAC tournament, as his team went 5-13 in conference play and 8-23 overall, meaning his season ended March 3. Bates had some moments, dropping a combined 66 points against South Carolina and Michigan, but was more or less a net negative in conference play He posted a paltry 49% true shooting percentage with far more turnovers than assists and while being a sieve defensively, often looking like he was barely trying while playing selfish basketball.  This probably wasn't what NBA scouts or Bates envisioned when he elected to transfer from Memphis last spring, and he has work ahead of him now to be a sure-fire draft pick if he enters. Standing 6-9 and having just turned 19 years old in late January, Bates' tough shot-making prowess and overall scoring instincts hold some appeal, but he plays such a losing brand of basketball on both ends of the floor, making him a relatively tough sell. -- Jonathan Givony
 It wasn’t long ago that Bates was viewed by most as a generational talent. He was the first sophomore to ever win Gatorade National Player of the Year and legitimately looked like one of the best high schoolers in the world at 16 years old.
Since then, the hype has only shrunk. While he had a spectacular finish to his high school career, some red flags did begin to appear with Bates, most notably with shot selection and decision making.
In what was a unique situation, Bates headed to college at 17 years old to play for Memphis. He was slated to have to play two college seasons due to being ineligible for the 2022 NBA Draft because of his age.
Last season, his freshman campaign with the Tigers was extremely underwhelming. On the biggest stage as one of the most anticipated players in the country, he battled injuries and struggled even when he was on the court.
Bates has always been an elite scorer, having no problem getting buckets from all three levels. He doesn’t have elite speed or quickness with the ball in his hands, but is extremely tall with a wide variety of dribble moves. The 6-foot-9 wing is a mismatch for opposing defenses and great in isolation.
There’s rarely a shot Bates takes that he doesn’t like. He’s proven to be willing and able to take shots of high difficulty, making stepbacks and fadeaways from everywhere on the court. Additionally, he’s got deep range and has no hesitation in shooting from 25 feet.
While he’s a gifted scorer that can generate a shot anytime he wants it, this often gets Bates in trouble. He’s known for sometimes shooting more than he should and being a ball stopper on offense. Can he develop into a player that can be effective within the flow of an offense and make the team around him better?
When Bates’ shot is falling, he looks like an elite NBA scorer that would thrive in the isolation style of the league. When it’s not, he looks lost and in over his head. This is why Memphis’ numbers looked much worse for most of his freshman season when Bates was on the floor than off. While his efficiency increased at Eastern Michigan as a sophomore, there's still questions.
Like most wings his age, Bates needs to add weight to his frame and get stronger. He’s really not an elite athlete and to this point has relied on skill over athleticism. He’s also got a negative wingspan which could concern some NBA teams.
On the flip side, Bates is one of the best wings in this class from a creation standpoint. He’s got a great handle for his size and is a decent passer. He might not be the passer, facilitator or decision maker that many hoped he would become, but there’s still a chance he evolves into a point forward.
The stakes were still be high this season after transferring to Eastern Michigan. He wasn't playing against the same level of competition, but NBA teams wanted see him dominate even more now. He did produce at a much higher level, and with an extra year of experience under his belt, the hope is that Bates begins to thrive in the pre-draft process.
The high school phenom dealt with several injures as a freshman and could never get into a rhythm, so that first college season could be taken with a grain of salt. Bates is an aggressive player and huge competitor that still has the potential to be a fantastic NBA talent.
There’s no reason to give up on the 19-year-old at this point, but he’s certainly not a lock to be taken in the first round of the upcoming draft. Bates is the type of player that could quickly rise up draft boards leading tup to the draft. There will likely be teams in the 2023 NBA Draft that are willing to take a risk on him regardless, but others may only view him as a second-round project.
Overall, Bates needs to become a better decision maker and improve his shot selection if he's going to be effective in the NBA. Learning to play within a defined role will be key for him moving forward. Can he be effective without being a volume shooter?"
Keyontae Johnson,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Justin Anderson
Strengths:
A physically strong 6’6 230 F/G with excellent length (6’11 wingspan) that allows him to play ‘taller’ than his height and decent athleticism and leaping ability…Uniquely versatile player who has experience playing SG-PF on both ends of the court…Resourceful scorer with mismatch ability (18 ppg on 53 FG% currently); can bully smaller wings as a slasher or posting up from as far out as 12-15 ft but also has enough touch to convert pull-up jumpers and 3s when guarded by slower frontcourt players…Master at up-and-unders, and consistently draws fouls (over 5 FTA a game at 75%) and converts tricky layups because of it…Picks his spots pretty well and does a nice job of attacking as soon as he sees daylight…Also has a solid turnaround J in the mid range…Knows how to use his strong upper body to create space when looking to slash as well as convert shots in the paint, but also is creative using angles and taking advantage of the rim & backboard to shield the ball from shot blockers, which is key for shorter frontcourt players…A consistent shooter with his feet set; legitimate 3-point range (39 3FG% on nearly 3 attempts per game) and is very good as a valve for dribble penetration…Rebounds well, especially for a 6’6 player (8 RPG as a Sr., nearly 7 rpg for his career) and is effective on the offensive glass…Doesn’t shy away from contact or bigger players and shows a pretty high motor…Moves well without the ball and has made a number of timely cuts that have resulted in backdoor alley-oops or open layups this season, let alone over his career…Mentally tough, competitive player…An overachieving type who gets the most out of himself whenever he takes the floor…
Weaknesses:
At around 6’6 and more of a frontcourt player than a true wing, Johnson is undersized for NBA SF standards…His lack of height is more of a concern defensively, where taller players can rise and shoot over him relatively easily and convert shots in the paint…Offers little in the way of a shot-blocking threat (0.3 bpg for his career)…His physicality and motor at times works against him on D, as he can at times be foul prone and handsy when guarding on the perimeter…There are some questions about what position he will defend in the NBA…Relies heavily on his right hand for finishes, and at times attempts unnecessarily tough shots around the rim because of it…Doesn’t get much elevation on his jumper, which limits the types of jumpers he can take against set defenses…Average ball-handling ability, almost exclusively a straight-like slasher…At times gets tunnel vision looking to score, which leads to him driving into no-mans land and turning the ball over or picking up offensive fouls (3.1 TOPG as a Sr.)…There may still be concerns about his medicals in the draft process after scary 2020 incident, but the fact that he has been medically cleared by the NCAA should quell fears…Despite developing his shooting (43% from 3 as a senior) considerably, his 72% career FT number is still a concern …
Overall:
The feel good story of college hoops this season has been the return and outstanding play of Florida transfer Keyontae Johnson, who has been a main reason that Kansas State has gone from a team that was picked to finish last in the Big 12 a current Top 10 team…After a scary, career-threatening collapsing incident in the beginning of the 2020-2021 season that derailed him for 2 seasons while at University of Florida, Johnson has come back even stronger than his previous form and has re-established himself as an NBA prospect and Conference POY candidate once again…He is averaging a career best 18 ppg and 8 rpg and has been a double-double machine; using his physicality, mismatch skillset and soft touch to produce nicely for KState…He is a bit undersized for a frontcourt player, and it effects him defensively when matched up with taller player, comes with an obvious medical history that will be closely monitored and he’s an older prospect who will be 23 years old for his rookie season in the pros…Still, there is alot to like about his versatile offensive game, length and the physicality he plays with…He will certainly have opportunities to make an NBA roster and there is a good chance he will hear his name called at the 2023 NBA Draft as well …
Notes:
Measured 6′ 4.00” barefoot, 8′ 7.00” standing reach, 238.6 lbs and a 7′ 00.00” wingspan at the 2023 NBA Draft Combine …
Jorrye Nixon 2/9/23  Johnson's NCAA tournament run was more inconsistent than one might expect relative to Kansas State's Elite Eight finish, sandwiching two average showings by his standards against Kentucky and Florida Atlantic with one strong performance against Michigan State, perhaps missing an opportunity to better solidify his standing as a first-round candidate.

There's a lot to like about Johnson's profile as a 6-6 combo forward who can stretch the floor (41% from 3), finish lobs or cuts with explosiveness at the rim and offer some multi-positional defensive versatility with his 230-pound frame, toughness and length. Every NBA team more or less is looking to add players in this mold to their rosters, and the fact he's turning 23 doesn't hurt him, considering he spent almost two years away from basketball dealing with a heart issue.

Johnson went just 3-for-11 on 3-pointers and 5-for-9 from the free throw line in four NCAA tournament games, settled for tough shots, made questionable decisions and had some costly lapses off the ball defensively in highlighting his average processing speed and feel for the game. He's a little more theoretical at times than one might hope for a fifth-year senior, but NBA teams will likely account for his time away from the game and consider he could very well still be shaking the rust off.

While Johnson might not have helped his cause to be considered a sure-fire first-rounder, he's a legitimate option in the second round and shows enough glimpses of ability on both ends of the floor to be a player for NBA teams to buy into at a position of need.-- Jonathan Givony  An experienced prospect with NBA upside, Johnson has re-emerged as one of the best players in the country again this season. He had a medical emergency on Dec. 12, 2020, during a Florida game that sidelined him for the remainder of his junior season. From there, he sat out his fourth season as a Gator before transferring this offseason. Prior to these events, he was viewed as a potential first-round talent.
Johnson took his talents to Kansas State for the 2022-23 season with one season of eligibility remaining after playing in those three seasons at Florida. While he is extremely experienced, but also is an older prospect. With that in mind, he’s got the tools to make contributions to an NBA team as a rookie.
For starters, he's a really good rebounder for his size. The 6-foot-6 prospect is very strong and has great length that allows him to defend multiple positions. More of a natural wing, he can slide down to defend some guards but also up to take on bigs.
While he can play upwards of three positions in college, Johnson will likely be a combo forward at the next level. As the competition and athleticism at every position increases, things will change for him.
Turnovers have been somewhat of an issue for him this season, so he needs show he’s a better decision maker as the postseason comes around. With that in mind, good things do usually happen when the ball is in Johnson’s hands.
Especially in transition, he has great feel for a forward. Johnson has the ability to pull down a rebound and push the break with confidence, which is a key skill in the modern NBA. Not only can he score at a high level in transition, but he’s got solid vision while running the floor.
Even in halfcourt sets, he’s generally comfortable with the ball in his hands. Johnson isn’t necessarily a point forward archetype, but he’s someone that can be a complimentary facilitator within the flow of the offense.
He’s more of a straight-line driver when it comes to generating his own shot, but is effective using his weight and strength to bully his defender on way to cup. Though he drives with power to rim, with a deceptively quick first step, the 6-foot-6 prospect has ability to change pace in order to regain balance and put the ball off the glass with touch. Johnson is having his best season as a scorer at the college level and is thriving in the Big 12 style of play.
He’s emerged as a fantastic 3-point shooter and also gets to the free throw line at a good rate, which is crucial for NBA scorers. Johnson has a quick release on his smooth jumper and can shoot from all levels. While he does take some questionable shots in the mid-range, he’s also improved in that area of the floor this season.

A great showing by Johnson and the Wildcats late in the recent college season was positive for his draft stock. The pre-draft process will now dictate whether or not he gets selected. 
What’s been extremely promising is that he’s had some of his best performances against the top teams in the conference. The former Oak Hill Academy standout and top 100 recruit is now 23 years old, but still should be getting attention from NBA teams in the coming weeks."
Jalen Wilson,"Analysis
NBA Compsrison: Kenrich Williams/Anthony Lamb
Strengths:
Wilson is a 6’7 225 forward with good strength to adequately match up on the wing and as a smallball PF at the pro level from a physical standpoint … Displayed good versatility in college and liked to operate as a matchup ploy; with experience playing different roles all along the frontcourt during his career, from SF to even sneaking in stretches of minutes as a smallball C at times … Plays physical and likes to use his size to shield defenders from the ball and get to his spots, and had major success doing so this past season (career best 20.1 PPG) … Navigates screens off the ball well and likes to use the running starts to build up momentum to get downhill after the catch … Teams knew he mostly wanted to go right when he had the ball last season and he still got to his spots more often than not … Adequate 1-2 dribble pull-up jump shooter from mid-range … Made enough deep shots when he was dared to shoot to keep the defense honest last season (7 made 3FG) … Show good timing and awareness as a cutter … Draws fouls and exponentially improved his FT% each year (80 FT% on 5.5 FTA/G) … Put up big scoring numbers as a rJr., but his rebounding instincts may be his best attribute as a player (8.3 RPG in ‘22-23, career 7.7 RPG) … High motor and competitive on the glass; boxes out well and consistently fights for boards, even when competing in traffic against bigger players … Unselfish and a team player; played whatever role he was asked to and got the most out of himself during his career …
Weaknesses:
His size was often an asset on the wing and against PFs at the college level, but it does not stand out for a combo forward by NBA standards, especially given his average length (6’8 wingspan) and a standing reach fit for a combo guard (8’3.5″) … It also doesn’t help that Wilson shows a lack of athleticism, particularly in terms of leaping and explosiveness … A below the rim player who isn’t going to blow by defenders much at the next level and struggled to convert amongst the trees (48 FG% inside the arc) … Jumper is inconsistent the further out he shoots (33.7 3FG% on over 5 3FGA/G; career 31.6 3FG%); got a fair amount of open shots around the perimeter and still went through a few slumps throughout the season … Was a volume scorer by necessity last season but isn’t a natural at creating for himself; doesn’t possess the kind of ball-handling to make something out of nothing at a high level and his production was often scheme manufactured … Very right-hand dependent, which is a tendency that will be picked up on easier at the pro level…Mostly passes as a last resort; will get tunnel vision and force shots at times when he should kicked out (2.2:2:3 A:TO) … Was not an impact player on the defensive end; doesn’t force many turnovers (0.4 BPG, 0.9 SPG), possesses middling lateral quickness and awareness and will have some questions about what position he’ll defend at the NBA level … Might struggle to defend wings in space and he doesn’t have the size to really defend on the frontline … Should look to tone down his body some and focus on adding more speed …
Overall:
Jalen Wilson was a 4-star recruit in the HS Class of 2019 from the Dallas area who had a productive and decorated career at Kansas over the past 3 years…His Fr. season ended in 2 games due to an ankle injury which led to him having to medically redshirt … He came back in 2020-2021 and immediately was a productive role player (11 PPG & 7 RPG) … It was more of the same for Wilson as a Soph., putting up identical stats while playing a key role as a 3rd option scorer for a Jayhawks team that won the 2022 national title … Kansas lost 2 1st round picks after the title and Wilson was called upon to step up to replace the production they lost, and Wilson delivered a monster season becoming just the 3rd player to average 20 PPG for Bill Self in his 20 years as the Kansas coach to go with over 8 boards, being a Wooden Award finalist … His physicality as a straight-line slasher, mismatch offensive ability, experience and rebounding instincts are a plus … He will need to prove he can be productive without being a focal point, and also answer questions about what position he’ll defend, his ability to be consistent as a shooter and how he’ll operate with the ball when he can simply overpower his matchups like he was often able to at the college level … Wilson’s draft range is late 1st to sometime around the mid 2nd round of the 2023 Draft, where some team could scoop him to be a rotational piece with his experience and championship pedigree …

Jorrye Nixon 6/7/23  Wilson exploded in his fourth season of college basketball, emerging as the Big 12 player of the year for defending national champions Kansas and helping the Jayhawks to not miss a beat from last season.

Wilson is their unquestioned go-to guy, shouldering a significant offensive load with varying degrees of efficiency, scoring inside the post, in the open floor, with mid-post isos and out of pick-and-rolls. Wilson plays a different role than the one he'd likely be asked to play in the NBA, and the question scouts will ask is whether he can become a good enough spot-up shooter, one-on-one defender and decision-maker with less offensive responsibility.

At 6-foot-7 with very little length and explosiveness, Wilson isn't blessed with huge upside, so finishing on a strong note will be important. The Jayhawks have a tough draw, playing several pro prospects on either Arkansas or Illinois in the second round should they advance past Howard, as expected.-- Jonathan Givony  Coming off of an NCAA Championship, Wilson took on even more of an important role in this recent college season. He proved to be up for the challenge and has elevated his game.

After entering the NBA Draft process the past two years, Wilson has ultimately ended up coming back to school both times, and now had a great fourth season.
Although he didn’t play much as a freshman, he’s grown into a veteran player that is a three-year starter. When looking at his production across the board, he's one of the most impactful players in the entire country. Wilson is the perfect example of a player developing over a full four years at the college level.
With that in mind, he is an older prospect and will be 23 years old during most of the upcoming NBA season. That's not to say he's already reached his ceiling and can't continue to improve, but generally players of that age are more of a second-round selection. Either way, he's got the talent and skillset to impact the game at the next level immediately.
A dominant rebounder, the 6-foot-8 forward led Kansas on the boards the last season. As a senior on his way to Big 12 Player of the Year honors, he nearly averaged a 20-point double-double. 
As an offensive player, Wilson often exploits mismatches. When traditional bigs defend him, he's got the quickness to blow by. He's also got solid post moves and is crafty in the paint. When smaller players defend him, he's got the strength and size to bully his way into the paint for an easy bucket.
Especially if the 3-point shot continues to improve, he’ll have the tools to be a fantastic player at the next level. Emerging as a prospect that can knock down even 35% of his triples at a consistent rate would really make it hard to pass on Wilson in the second round of the 2023 NBA Draft. He's got the size and production that can't be denied. He shot a career-high 33.7% from deep on nearly six attempts per game last season.
Defensively, Wilson is fundamentally sound, but certainly not a stopper. He can defend upwards of three positions depending on the matchup on a given night. It will be fascinating to see whether he ends up being more of a wing or power forward at the next level.
Even playing alongside standout freshman Gradey Dick, Wilson maintained his level of production which is impressive."
Toumani Camara,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Torrey Craig
Strengths:
Athletic and agile wing who is an outstanding rebounder and versatile defender on the wing … Drastic improvement throughout his college career as a 3-point shooter. Started at 17% on less than an attempt per game and evolved into a 36% shooter by the end of his career on over two attempts per game … Agile slasher who draws contact and finishes around the hoop with tremendous efficiency and touch (60.6% on 2-point attempts) … Averaged 8.6 rebounds per game this season, including over two rebounds on the offensive glass … Exceptional size on the wing, combined with plus athleticism should allow him to guard 1-4 at the next level as a defensive specialist. One of the most underrated defenders in the 2023 NBA Draft class … Keeps his head up when he slashes from the wing with quick twitches and solid footwork around the basket … Scores out of face ups and post ups with this footwork and shifty changes of speed … Can be an outstanding help side rim protector as he nearly averaged a block per game in his final three collegiate seasons … Above average playmaker for his size … Hard worker who can contribute as a spark plug off the bench with versatility on both ends of the floor … Filled out frame at 6’7, 220 pounds, allowing him to hold his own in the post … Projects as a rotational wing who brings energy and experience to the Phoenix Suns who need guys to fill out their rotation with the high percentage of the salary cap they are giving to four players … Can score with either hand in the post …
Weaknesses:
Emerged as a decent shooter from beyond the arc, but a lot of these looks were surrendered by opponents because of his inconsistency as a shooter. Might not pose enough of a threat from the perimeter to keep defenders honest and bring out the true strengths of his game … Took advantage of the athletic gap he had against the weaker competition in the A-10, which will come to a swift end in his first minutes in the NBA … Didn’t test as well athletically as many expected. Seems to play as much more of a leaper than his vertical tests indicated at the combine … Inefficient free-throw shooter at 63% for his career … Already 23 years old … Not an extremely high upside player. Projects as more of a sparingly played role player who needs to earn more minutes

Derek Bast 6/22/23  Camara is a prospect that has continued to rise over the past few months and will get real draft consideration in June. He recently turned 23, but still is worthy of a second-round pick with what he brings to the table.
The Dayton big was the clear best prospect in the Portsmouth Invitational Tournament in April. His ability to blow-by bigs, perimeter skill, and ambidextrous finishing made him a mismatch nightmare for opposing defenders. He’s an explosive finisher around the rim with the ability to stretch the floor. He defended well and had some nice passing flashes that we didn’t get to really see at Dayton.
An undersized frontcourt player, Camara is a two-time All-A10 player and earned an All-A10 Defensive Team nod last season. His frame allows him to be extremely physical on the defensive end of the floor.
While he’s been a starter since his freshman season, Camara has shown tremendous improvement since starting his college campaign. He’s not an elite athlete but has plenty of athletic tools that he leverages well. His offensive efficiency from floor overall and from deep has steadily increased as his four college seasons progressed.
Last season, Camara averaged nearly 14 points per game while shooting 54.6% from the floor and 36.3% from deep. His shot still feels inconsistent game-to-game though and he has work to do as a free throw shooter. Consistency is key and something he’ll have to show in pre-draft process. On the offensive end he understands angles well and is a good cutter, knowing how to put himself in the right spot for looks he is refers. With that in mind, he isn’t a good self-creator which is why he’s somewhat limited with the ball in his hands.
Camara is a solid rebounder and overall uses his strong frame well. He had turnover issues earlier in career but has gotten better in that respect. Furthermore, he does have some passing upside for a forward. If he can continue to improve as 3-point shooter, he should find a nice role in NBA with his size and versatility on both ends. It will be interesting to see what types of frontcourt players he meshes best with.
Camara played alongside several other potential future NBA prospects in DaRon Holmes II, Mike Sharavjamts and Kobe Elvis. After getting an NBA Draft Combine invite, he’ll get the chance to showcase his upside."

NBA Comparison: Bryant Stith
Strengths:
Suffocating perimeter defender who was widely recognized as the best perimeter defender in college basketball this season … Incredibly disciplined defender who laterally moves his feet masterfully and fully extends on contests without fouling … An aggressive defender who took on the toughest matchups, yet stayed out of foul trouble and rarely conceded easy buckets … Intelligent defender who loves to force ball-handler toward the baseline and still stay in front. Even when he gets beat for a step, he recovers well and can block shots from behind with a great wingspan for his size (6’4 height and 6’9 wingspan) … Great anticipation as a defender, both on and off the ball, to force turnovers on charges or steals. Lays his body on the line … Very effective guarding 1-3. Can hold his own in the post, even against taller 4’s with exceptional upper body strength … Defensive playmaker … Possesses Jose Alvarado type of energy, never taking a play off to allow lead ball-handlers to relax or bring it up the floor easily … Always thinking and moving off the ball on both ends. Simply makes plays that don’t show up on the stat sheet … Averaged 2.6 steals per game … Comfortable ball-handler who showed flashes of impressive scoring as a junior, doubling his scoring average from 6.7 points to 13 points per game … An absolute workhorse who will tire out an entire team with his constant movement on both ends of the floor … Finishes well around the rim as evidenced by a 54.4% career shooting percentage from inside the arc … Rebounded above his height with six total per game as a junior, including two offensive boards per game … Solid vertical athlete, at least pre-injury …
Weaknesses:
Funky shooting motion and poor shooting percentage in his career project him as an unreliable floor spacer, at least early in his career. Improved to a 33% shooter from the perimeter this season, but the mechanics and bad misses indicate he won’t be a consistent threat from 3-point range … Could benefit from a complete overhaul with his shooting mechanics … More smarts than speed as slasher, which won’t work often against high-level NBA defenders … Won’t keep opponents honest as a ball-handler, limiting how much he can score off the dribble as teams dare him to shoot off the bounce … Coming off a season-ending Achilles injury, the extent of which is unknown, but did require surgery shortly after it occurred in early March … Even if he’s available to start the NBA season, it will be tough to contribute consistent minutes with how little he brings to the offense at the next level. Excluding his off-ball intelligence that leads to easy layups on cuts, Clark’s presence could make it much easier to defend offensive sets if he can’t provide a shooting threat from the wing …

Measured 6’4.00” barefoot, 8’5.50” standing reach, 204.2 lbs, and a 6’9.00 wingspan at the 2023 NBA Draft Combine … 2023 Naismith Men’s Defensive Player of the Year and NABC Defensive Player of the Year … Second-Team All-Pac 12 in 2023 … Pac-12 All-Defense in 2022 and 2023 … Played for Compton Magic AAU program
Derek Bast 6/22/23  A defense-oriented role player his first two seasons, Clark has expanded his game and emerged as a highly efficient third option for an 11-2 UCLA team that many consider to be a legitimate Final Four contender. Clark put his defensive prowess on full display earlier this month with a comprehensive shutdown of Kentucky freshman and projected top-10 pick Cason Wallace, under the watchful eyes of many NBA executives at Madison Square Garden, limiting him to seven points, zero assists and two turnovers on 2-for-13 shooting in UCLA's win.  Clark's combination of length, strength, quickness and intensity is highly impactful, as he regularly steps in for charges, helps off the ball and wreaks havoc getting in passing lanes and crashing the glass. He ranks first in steals among all prospects in the top 100 and is tops among guards in rebounding, but has also found ways to be productive offensively as well, averaging 22 points per 40 on an efficient 66% true shooting percentage while rarely turning the ball over. Most of his offense comes in transition, posting up and attacking closeouts on straight-line drives, but he has also shown some flashes of effectiveness overpowering weaker defenders off the dribble, finishing through contact and splashing open 3-pointers, hitting 11-for-28 from beyond the arc through 12 games.  Despite the improved play, Clark has some things to prove in Pac-12 play, specifically how translatable or sustainable his offensive game is. He's an average ball handler and passer who plays a lot of bully ball, using his strong frame, and sports a big windup on his stiff spot-up 3-pointer, needing time to get his jumper off and struggling when asked to shoot off the bounce. He's a career 63% free throw shooter and 31% from beyond the arc but has tremendous touch around the basket that indicates he has room to grow in this area. Already playing a similar role to the one he'd be asked to play in the NBA, Clark is in an outstanding situation to help UCLA to a deep NCAA tournament run, which would put him in position to hear his name called on draft night. -- Jonathan Givony
  A former four-star recruit in class of 2020, Clark has taken some time to come around, but has really blossomed into solid player with NBA upside. After being one of best reserves in the country as a sophomore, he became a solidified starter as a junior and thrived in his increased role.
While his season was cut short due to an Achilles injury, he still has tremendous upside as an NBA player.
Clark has long been known for his defensive impact, which led to Pac-12 All-Defensive Team honors as sophomore and Pac-12 Defensive Player of the year more recently. He simply plays bigger than himself, defending guys much bigger than him at times while also pulling down nearly two offensive boards per game despite being a guard. He's a quick leaper that can get off the ground quicker than most to play above the rim.
He's a fantastic defender in help situations and overall raises the ceiling of his team's defense overall, scaling his impact outside of his own individual assignment. 
With a unique blend of strength, explosiveness and agility, the UCLA prospect is able to do many things that other 6-foot-5 guards are unable to do. Combine that with his high motor and constant effort, and it’s easy to see why he’s improved with each college season.
On the offensive end, Clark has doubled his scoring output year-over-year and has shown a ton of growth there. He's very smart about finding ways to get easy looks. Whether it's as a cutter or a mover, he often gets easy layups, especially when he hangs out in the dunker spot.
He's also gotten patient in the mid-range and likes to back his defender down while he surveys the floor to kick the ball back out or score.
While he would be an older prospect in the 2023 NBA Draft, the experience and poise that comes along with that balances it out. He will have played close to 100 college games by the end of this season and has a skillset that could help impact winning from day one in the NBA.
One of the traits that makes Clark so special is his nose for the ball. He’s an elite rebounder for his position, pulling down more than nearly every other power five guard in the country.
His medicals and injury outlook will be something NBA teams monitor during the pre-draft process with Clark."
Jalen Slawson,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Josh Minott
Strengths:
Elite and versatile defender who developed into an impressive three-level scorer for a high flying Furman offense … Developed into more than just a reliable 3-point shooter, posting a 39% percentage from beyond the arc on three attempts per game this season … One of the most productive defenders in the country, averaging a steal and a half or more in both blocks and steals over the last two seasons … Can guard any player in the frontcourt effectively and should instill confidence in his coaches when he switches onto guards. Could obviously struggle in these matchups, but won’t be a liability by any measure … Instinctive off-ball defender who generates steals and projects as a solid help-side rim protector from either the 3 or 4 position … Impressive downhill driver who uses his physical frame to earn trips to the foul line, where he shoots at a solid 78% over the last two seasons. Averaged nearly five free throw attempts per game … Impressive playmaker from the wing as well, averaging over three assists per game the past two seasons … Powerful, versatile screener who can pop out for 3-pointers, slip to the basket and finish with strength or create for others in the short roll. Sacramento’s system of ball screens and floor spacing should play to all of Slawson’s strengths as a second-unit playmaker who should gel perfectly with De’Aaron Fox. Proved he can play with a skilled lead guard with Mike Bothwell at Furman … Extremely physical on ball defender, which can lead to foul trouble, but does show he can hang with NBA athletes … Long arms (6’11.75” wingspan) and lateral quickness allow him to recover defensively and block shots from behind even when he loses a step off the dribble … Runs the floor well in transition, sometimes as a ball-handler, always keeping his head up and reading the floor …
Weaknesses:
The largest gripe with Slawson is the lack of true competition he played against in the Southern Conference and a very old draft age (turns 24 on October 22) … While he looks the part of an elite slasher in his tape, he will find far more difficulty winning off the dribble at the next level. Boasted elite efficiency around the rim, but rarely had to go up against even average shot blockers … Long release to his outside jumper. Almost pushes it at the top of the release instead of going in one fluid motion … Staying on the floor has proved difficult throughout his career as he tends to miss large stretches of the game through foul trouble. Will be difficult to carve out a role if this continues at the next level … Right-hand dominant who is almost guaranteed to spin back to his right if he drives left … Smarter scouting will lead to heavy forces to his left, daring him to make a play going to his weaker side … Turnovers were a consistent problem with more than two per game in his final three seasons … Upside is low with his high draft age and glaring weaknesses from a foul trouble and left hand driving perspective that never improved despite his experience … Many of his assists were system dependent, but his accuracy and timing both in transition and in the half court are admittedly impressive
Notes:
Measured 6′ 6.5” barefoot, 8′ 10” standing reach, 221.6 lbs and a 6′ 11.75” wingspan and a 29 inch standing vertical and a 33′ inch max vertical at the 2023 NBA Draft Combine … Five-year player, four-year starter at Furman … 2021-22 SoCon Defensive Player of the Year … 2022-23 SoCon Player of the Year … Two-time All-SoCon First Team selection … Helped lead the Paladins to their second NCAA Tournament win in school history … Selected 54th overall by the Sacramento Kings in the 2023 NBA Draft …
Derek Bast 6/22/23  With five college seasons under his belt, Slawson will be 24 most of the upcoming season at the next level. A player that has improved tremendously with each season in college, his production and level of skill has come a long way.

At 6-foot-7, he’s a great positional passer. In fact, he acted as an offensive hub to a degree at Furman where he demanded gravity due to his scoring upside which allowed him to find cutters and open teammates on the perimeter.
Although still on relatively low volume, Slawson has come around as a 3-point shooter. He still needs to develop a quicker, more consistent release, but he’s at least emerged as a quality perimeter threat. Even then, he’s best as a driver that finishes very well at the rim. Slawson has also gotten better at drawing contact and getting to the free throw line.
As a driver, he’s more powerful than quick, and isn’t necessarily the best self-creator. He’s able to bully defenders to get the rack, although that will be more difficult to do at the next level.

Defensively, Slawson will be best suited guarding forwards in the NBA early on. He can also take on certain wings and centers, although he is undersized for a big and lacks elite lateral quickness on the perimeter. Either way he’s disruptive, notching three stocks per game as a fifth year senior. Slawson is also a good rebounder which should translate moving forward.
At the NBA level, it will be interesting to see if Slawson can function as this undersized forward or if he’ll need to improve his perimeter skills. The size, strength and athleticism he’s set to face from here will be much greater than what he went up against in college. He will likely need to improve his perimeter skills so that he’s more effective as a combo forward at 6-foot-7.

Unlocking that ability could come down to decision making, which is something Slawson struggled with at times. As good of a passer as he is, the 23-year-old sometimes tries doing too much and turns it over. His handle also needs to improve if he’s going to have the versatility to play on the wing in the NBA.
Basketball is in Slawson’s genes, as his dad played at The Citadel and his cousin, RJ Slawson, played at South Carolina."
Isaiah Wong,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Jared Butler
Strengths:
Wong is a 6’4 180 PG/SG with adequate athleticism, showing decent levels of quickness, leaping skills and agility … Productive guard who is at his best putting the ball in the basket (averaged at least 15.3 PPG in each of his last 3 seasons) … Can create for himself and was a tough player to defend at the college level because of his skill level and ability to score in different ways … Utilizes ball-screens well and generally makes good reads when calling his own number; will make defenders pay when they dive and can turn the corner on favorable switches … Good crossover and can freeze defenders to get space for step-backs and pull-up jumpers from mid-range and 3 … Also is not a bad shooter with his feet set; steps into shots with confidence and can operate off-ball as a dribble penetration or transition floor spacer (38 3FG% as a Sr., around 35 3FG% average for his career) … Body control and footwork allow him to step-through and maneuver around bodies and he shows enough touch to convert tricky shots … Smooth turnaround jumper to use defenders momentum against them … Good enough 1st step to threaten the paint and get into the teeth of the defense with some success, particularly with the help of a ball screen…Some ability to play above the rim in space and has some moments of success slashing and finishing in transition … Can make simple reads with the ball in transition & pick and roll offense, and handles hedges and tilted defenses reasonably well to get the ball to the open man (career-best 3.2 APG as a Sr.)…Takes care of the ball (1.7 TOPG for his career) … Seemed more and more willing to compete on the defensive end as his career went along, and he usually tries to get back in plays when beat (50 career blocks, career-best 1.4 SPG as a Sr.) … Chipped in on the glass from the perimeter a bit at the college level, and had some moments turning missed shots into transition opportunities (4.1 RPG career) … Experience playing both on and off the ball is a plus … Good FT shooter (career 80% on 4 FTA/G)…Accomplished player with winning pedigree and a reputation as a hard worker; was an All-Conference performer for 3 straight years and led Miami to some pretty deep, unexpected NCAA Tournament runs as an upperclassman …
Weaknesses:
Wong has an average physical profile by NBA standards for a combo guard and that might present a cap on the types of things he can do at the pro level compared to college … Is more of an undersized SG than a point; usually looks to handle the ball and use screens for his own scoring opportunities & shows average floor vision and instincts as a facilitator … Has his moments when he pounds the ball and tries to do too much when he should swing and let plays develop … Sometimes can be too reliant on ball screen action to create driving lanes for himself, and will settle at times … Takes some tougher, highly contested shots that may not work as well against bigger, more athletic professional players and his ability to finish efficiently was already mediocre at the college level as is (48 FG% inside the arc as a Sr.) … 3-point shot can be a bit streaky at times … Though not broken, he will need to be more consistent spotting up considering that he would probably see much more time off the ball than as a primary ball-handler in the NBA … Doesn’t project to be much of a disruptive defender at the next level, and he will likely have to either guard the smallest player on the court or the least viable scoring options every time…Tough to point out a true standout skill that he has by NBA standards …
Overall:
Isaiah Wong was a consensus 4-star recruit playing HS ball in both PA and NJ, and signed to Miami were he saw immediate key minutes and eventually won a starting job halfway into his Fr. season … From then he would become one of the most productive players in the ACC over the next 3 seasons and also one of the very best players in school history for the Hurricanes, wrapping up his career as the programs 4th all-time leading scorer with over 1800 points while helping led Miami to the Elite 8 & the school’s first ever Final 4 appearance … He often showed his shot-making prowess in those tournament runs, with 4 20-point games in his 9 career tournament appearances … As a prospect Wong brings some 3-level scoring ability and a nice skill level to the table, being able to operate on or off the ball to get buckets … He is a decent athlete, can make some tough shots and generally takes care of the ball as well … There are concerns about his average physical tools, lack of standout traits, and middling PG skills as a combo guard, as well as him being an older, lower upside type with some defensive matchup questions … But still his productive college career and ability to score in different ways make him a lower risk prospect to gamble on in the 2nd round of the 2023 Draft …
Notes:
Measured 6′ 2.50” barefoot, 8′ 1.50” standing reach, 178.4 lbs, and 6′ 6.75” wingspan with a 37 inch max vertical at the 2023 NBA Draft Combine …
Jorrye Nixon 6/1/23  There’s no question that Wong could have made the jump to the NBA at some point in the last two years. As a sophomore at Miami, he was a full time starter and averaged over 17 points per game. Even last year, Wong declared for the 2022 NBA Draft while maintaining college eligibility, worked out with several NBA teams, but ended up coming back for this most recent season. He’s now played four years at the college level in effort to win a championship, which he got fairly close to doing last season.
Set to be a quality prospect in the 2023 NBA Draft, he leaves Miami as a three-time All-ACC player and the ACC Player of the Year for the 2022-23 season.
Wong truly has the ability to make an impact on both ends. He’s not the biggest guard, but is laterally quick and is extremely disruptive on that end. This led to 1.4 steals per game as a senior, as he navigated passing lanes and defended well on-ball.
He’s also an extremely advanced shotmaker, which was on full display in the tournament. While some of the top scorers in the country produce most of their points in rhythm or off the catch, Wong can legitimately create for himself and knock down tough shots. Whether it’s turnaround fadeaways, step back triples, or other NBA-level moves, that upside offensively jumps off the page.
He’s also a good positional rebounder and takes good care of the ball, so it feels like he has a solid floor as an NBA player. Combine that with his ability to make big shots and his chance of being an effective bench spark is easy to see. With that in mind, he needs to get better as a facilitator, which will only take his upside to a new level. Wong is extremely explosive and has shown at times in college that he can be extremely effective defending on the perimeter.
It’s unlikely Wong is a first-round selection, especially given he’s already 22, but as a second rounder he would be a great selection for any team. A former four-star recruit, the 6-foot-4 guard played against a high level of competition at the high school level. This is a huge reason he was able to make an immediate impact at the college level, including multiple 20-point games as a freshman."

Strengths:
All Around wing… Great size for his position… Solid length, with a 6-11 wingspan… Good physical profile with an OK body structure… Nice, wide shoulders… Runs the floor well… Versatile can play in either wing position and  if body continues to fill up he could play 2-4 in the future… Can be effective playing on and off the ball… Has the potential to become a playmaking wing… Smooth shooting mechanics… His shooting release looks effortless, he has the same form both in Spot Ups and Pull Ups… A natural shooter and a threat in Spot Up actions… Has shown potential in off screen actions, coming from stagger screens and taking quick shots… Attacks close outs at a good level, taking advantage of the fact that defenses respect his shooting ability… Has a good Pull Up shot in his arsenal and is a solid shooter from mid-range… An above average ball handler, with a nice crossover dribble in his arsenal (from left to right) and some hesitation moves… Moves well away off the ball, with smart cuts to the basket… Has shown potential as a secondary playmaker, with solid results in Pick and Roll actions as the ball handler… Knows how to use screens before decide either to shoot or pass the ball… Has solid court vision in Pick and Rolls, can see with ease the weakside thanks to his size… Good rebounder for his position… His size helps him on defense… Above average Post Up defender… Smart weakside defender, has a solid understanding of defensive rotations…
Weaknesses:
An average athlete by NBA standards… Playing for an established team for years with a lot of veterans, he lacked playing time and his development kind of stacked… Has some ups and downs in the same game, he can make some good plays in a row and then have some head scratching moments due to inexperience… Has just an OK first step, which causes him problems against athletic defenders in ISO situations… Ball handling needs some polishing, should improve dribbling with his left (weak) hand… Can establish position in the Post, but can’t really punish miss-matches against physical opponents for now… Doesn’t really drive to the basket much, more of a Jump Shooter… Finishing at the rim with his left hand needs work… Doesn’t draw a lot of fouls due to playing style… He should add a floater to his game to be able to mix it up… Settles for contested mid-range shots when he is heavily guarded, since he can’t really create seperation… Still needs work as the ball handler in Pick and Roll actions, decision making isn’t completely there… He might try some pocket passes in Pick and Rolls that just aren’t there… Has the tendency to kick his leg out when he shoots the ball to initiate contact, which leads to getting called for fouls… Average lateral quickness… Athletic wings and guard can get past him in ISO situations… Can get dragged behind screens in Pick and Roll actions when he defends the ball handler… Has problems when chasing players around screens…
Overall:
Tarik Biberovic is a versatile wing with good size… Shooting is his calling card, but has shown potential as a secondary playmaker… At the same time, his lack of playing time the last couple of years and average athleticism are concerning… If he manages to have consistent playing time in Europe to figure things out, he could become an all around point forward

NBA Comparison: Jaylin Williams/Trey Lyles
Strengths:
TJD stepped up this season becoming one of the most productive players in the country, solidifying himself as the draft’s top senior prospect … Bigtime athlete with explosive leaping ability and very good second leaping for rebounds … Dissects defenses with high-post and short-roll playmaking, as well as terrific vision out of low-post double teams … Doubled his assist numbers from two to four in his senior season … Elite shot blocker and rim-protector with his remarkable leaping ability and defensive instincts. Ranked fourth in D-1 with 2.9 blocks per game … Excellent mobility and athleticism on both ends of the floor … Tied for sixth at the NBA Combine with a 33-inch standing vertical leap … Outstanding pick-and-roll screener with the terrific lateral quickness to quickly shift directions and get up for lobs around the rim … Creates shots in isolations with twitchy lateral movement and the speed to get around his defender and to the rim. Can exploit mismatches against less mobile centers in the NBA as a “small ball” five … Switchable defender with a 7’1 wingspan … Deep bag of post moves over either shoulder. Long arms allow him turn post spins into dunks with deep enough positioning … Highlight finisher around the rim with the acrobatics and athleticism to throw down reverse slams and contour his body around rim-protectors. Ferocious above-the-rim athlete … Excellent rim runner who can finish anything thrown near the rim … Runs the floor masterfully in transition with speed and intelligence … Energetic rebounder, especially on the offensive end, who averaged 2.8 offensive boards in his four-year career with the Hoosiers … Stayed out of foul trouble his entire career with less than two fouls committed per game … Experienced and productive two-way player who will contribute immediately at the next level … Lefty with smooth, underrated shooting stroke who may be able to extend his range over time …
Weaknesses:
Three point shot has not shown much development, raising question marks about his ability to add that to his repertoire, although teammates rave of his work ethic and desire to get better, so I wouldn’t put anything past him … Despite working hard in the offseason, he didn’t even attempt a 3-pointer in his senior season, though perhaps that was following his role and coaching strategy … Only went 0-3 in his career from long distance … Free-throw percentage remained steady around 68% for Jackson-Davis’s entire career … Already 23 years old … Currently seen as an undersized five without the shooting threat to play as a four … Will need to make up for his in-between size with dominance off the dribble and competitive leaping ability with larger centers as a smaller five
Outlook:
One of the most productive forwards in college basketball over the last three seasons …Jackson-Davis will flourish in a middle of the floor/top of the key playmaking role that utilizes his terrific court vision and decisive decision-making in the middle of the floor. A two-man game with an elite PG and TJD reading the defense in the center of the offense can exploit defenses and create countless open looks for a 3-shooter system around him. Teams will have to respect his post scoring dominance in this scenario, bringing continuity and countless options to a brilliant offensive minded coach. A role similar to Draymond Green in GS or Domantas Sabonis role in Sacramento is the perfect way to incorporate him into the offense.

Derek Bast 6/6/23  Jackson-Davis finished his All-America season with another gaudy stat line of 23 points, eight rebounds and five blocks in Indiana's loss to Miami, posting similar numbers in the first round against Kent State with five assists for good measure. There is no bigger mismatch in college with Jackson-Davis' ability to push off the defensive glass, pass out of short rolls, and slither around and score over defenders in the post with exquisite footwork and body control. His lack of physicality proved to be an issue at times on the interior and he still has some things to prove as a pick-and-roll defender with his inconsistent intensity level. But it's hard to find a big man with better basketball instincts and there certainly wasn't a more consistently versatile college player in terms of the various ways he fills up the stat sheet.

As a 6-9 center with no shooting range, Jackson-Davis' fit in the modern NBA is still somewhat peculiar. Teams who value skill and feel for the game will be attracted to Jackson-Davis' productivity and the considerable improvement he's shown over the past year, giving him a case to be drafted in the first round.-- Jonathan Givony  Although he’s an older prospect, Jackson-Davis will have interest from NBA teams ahead of this summer’s draft. He’s got a great combination of size and athleticism that allows him to bully defenders in the paint.
At almost 250 pounds, he would actually be one of the heavier players in the NBA which means that strength should translate well at the next level. He's a double-double machine with the ability to score at a high level and clean the glass.
The lefty forward plays with a lot of energy and does most of his damage in the paint on offense. Jackson-Davis is patient with his post moves and has good balance. He feels his defender well when backing them down in the paint and loves to spin into a dunk or layup. He can finish with both hands, but definitely prefers turning into a left-handed shot in the post.
In terms of where his offense lacks, it’s essentially anything outside of the paint. Furthermore, his face-up game needs work. Jackson-Davis has shown a willingness to shoot more midrange jumpers of late, but he’s not a 3-point threat at all. Not only does he not take many shots from deep, but he doesn’t convert on them either. He’d only shot three times from beyond the arc in his four-year college career and made none of them.
Again, he’s extremely efficient near the rim, but not as much anywhere else on the floor. The senior does have the ability to take defenders off the bounce and create for himself at the rim though.
Outside of the jumper, Jackson-Davis’ skillset makes him somewhat of a tweener as it relates to his NBA position. This makes it difficult to evaluate him as a prospect at the next level. He’s a bit too small to play center but doesn’t necessarily have the range and skill of many modern forwards.
Due to this, he may have to be a situational role player at the highest level in small ball lineups, which obviously could limit his ceiling.
With that in mind, he still does plenty of things that should get NBA teams excited about him as a risk later in draft or as an undrafted free agent.
He’ll need to be more disciplined this season to improve draft stock as he’s known for sometimes being turnover prone.
Jackson-Davis is a solid defender and has shown some versatility on that end of the floor in pick-and-role situations as well as in the paint against bigger centers. While he did earn two Big Ten All-Defense nods during the course of his career, schemes and matchups look a lot different at the next level.
The former four-star recruiter from Indiana has been a fantastic player for his home state Hoosiers during his long college career. The son of former NBA player Dale Davis, he will look to be the next in his family to make it to the league.
Jackson-Davis is coming off of four All-Big Ten campaigns and was in the running for the Naismith College Player of the Year, as one of the most decorated prospects of the past half decade. He declared for 2022 NBA Draft initially but dropped out for another season at Indiana.

He had the opportunity to play alongside familiar faces again last season on a veteran Hoosiers roster but had the pleasure of taking the floor with freshman and potential first rounder Jalen Hood-Schifino."
Chris Livingston,"Analysis
NBA Comparison: Mike Moser
Strengths:
Strong, compact build (6’6”, 219 lbs) should allow him to handle NBA physicality … Rebounded the ball well to close his single season of college play, averaging 7.9 per game over the final 8 games despite playing next to the NCAA’s leading rebounder … Good explosiveness. Solid leaper who finishes well on the break … Recorded a 37 inch max vertical at the NBA Draft Combine … Excels at crashing the boards from the perimeter. Makes good cuts on offense that can allow him to get easy looks if playing next to a quality playmaker … Has a compact, consistent shot release that if honed, could develop into a threat – especially from the corners where many of his college attempts came from … Can finish strong on straight line drives to the rim. Will run the court in transition looking to get easy baskets. Can use his size and strength to bully smaller defenders around the paint …
Weaknesses:
Has no real concept of what he is as a player and what his limitations are – played a small ball four in college, but seems to believe he is more of a wing player. .. Extremely loose handle with no creation skill … Has very little wiggle to his game – isn’t going to go around anybody with the ball in his hand. Lacks offensive versatility, practically all of his offense came right at the rim or from three – nothing in between … Shot only 30.5% from three in college on 1.7 attempts per game. Most of his offense was the result of a teammate setting him up or from him getting an offensive rebound and putback. His slow, two footed gathers when attacking the rim will allow NBA level players enough time to recover and contest his looks at the rim. Has essentially two moves when driving to the rim, a weak euro step without mush side to side movement and trying to drive right through defenders which could lead to offensive fouls. Rarely gets to the free throw line (1.6 attempts per game). Ball tends to stick in his hands on offense and he doesn’t create looks for others (lowest assist rate on team amongst players with 200 minutes). Lacks lateral quickness to defend wing players at the next level … He’s an explosive athlete, but seems to lack ideal coordination and smoothness/flexibility in his movements …
Outlook:
Livingston is a player with a lot of physical tools, but is likely entering the draft before he’s ready … Despite being a highly regarded high school prospect, he seemed to peak at 16 years of age … He showed very little production in college (6.3 points, 4.2 rebounds, .7 assists, .4 blocks, .4 steals, on 42.9% shooting) and doesn’t have the dominant physical prowess to overcome that … He had the 8th slowest lane agility time at the combine, and didn’t flash in the other athletic testing … At the combine he measured in with a 6’11.5” wingspan, but at Kentucky’s Pro Day he measured 6’8”, so the length of his arms is a question … If an NBA team takes him, they are banking on his potential, as he’s young and has the type of body teams love for their wings. However, the mix of skills and athleticism just aren’t there yet … He’s at his best when he can just react and play off of playmaking teammates, but ultimately, he’s currently the type of player that NBA teams bring in one ten day contracts, not in the first round of the draft. If he gets selected, look for him to spend a lot of time in the G-League …
Notes:
Measured 6′ 6.00” barefoot,  8′ 8.50” standing reach, 219.2 lbs and a 6′ 11.25” wingspan with a 37 inch max vert at the 2023 NBA Draft Combine …
Eric Yearian 6/2/23
Strengths:
6’7 wing … Good length with a 6’10 wingspan … Strong frame that has been filled out throughout high school … Explosive athlete with fluid movements. Quick first step and aggressive slasher. Can be hard to stop in transition. Initiates contact and draws fouls at a solid rate … Provides a scoring mentality. Although efficiency can improve, he’s a safe bet to fill up the scoring column … Shooting range extends to the NBA 3PT line. Can shoot off the dribble with good elevation and arc. Gets his shot off with a little bit of space … Shows ability and willingness to post up smaller defenders and utilized the mismatch … Unselfish with solid passing ability, knows where his open shooters are. Doesn’t hunt for his scoring … Good rebounder for position. Rebounding stats: 8 RPG U16 Americas Championship 2019, 8.4 RPG adidas 3SSB 2021, 6.5 RPG NIBC 2021-22 … Good tools, versatility, and physicality as a defender. Solid shot blocker for position …
Weaknesses:
Can improve shooting consistency and efficiency, also as a finisher at the rim. Scoring stats: 14.8 PPG 46.2% FG% U16 Americas Championship 2019, 21.2 PPG 41.6% FG% 3SSB 2021, 14 PPG 46.8% FG% NIBC 2021-22 … Settles for deep 3s at times and more of a streaky shooter than knock down. 3PT Shooting: 23.5% 3PT% 3.4 3PTA U16 Americas Championship 2019, 28.6% 3PT% adidas 3SSB 2021, 29.3% 3PT% 4.1 3PTA NIBC 2021-22 … Can improve as a ball-handler as he needs triple-threat to get to the rim. Doesn’t have a lot of creativity or wiggle off the dribble … Can add more to his scoring arsenal, especially in the half-court, if that’s going to be his identity at the next levels … Needs a more consistent motor as he can be content spotting up or standing at the elbow and watching the action. Can show more commitment defensively … Favors going right on his drives … Can grow as a leader …
Outlook:
Incoming Kentucky freshman … Transferred to Oak Hill Academy for his senior year … Recorded 13 points (5-9 FG, 2-4 3PT), 6 rebounds, and 5 assists in the 2022 McDonald’s All-American … Recorded 21 points, 7 rebounds, and 3 steals in the 2022 Jordan Brand Classic … 2021 Ohio Gatorade Player of the Year … 2022 Virginia Gatorade Player of the Year … 2022 Naismith All-American 2nd Team … Won MVP and Gold at the U16 Americas Championship in 2019 …
Evan Tomes 7/24/22  Livingston was an early bloomer who received quite a bit of attention as a high school freshman before bouncing around some and ending up at Oak Hill Academy. He's a strong-framed combo forward who is physically ready for the college level, playing the type of hard-nosed, aggressive style on both ends of the floor that John Calipari likes from his forwards. Livingston is very effective attacking in a straight line, pushing the ball in the open court, and using his strength around the rim. He can pass the ball effectively as well, even if his decision-making and shot selection leaves something to be desired at times.  Livingston's jumper was streaky in high school, but he has shown some ability to make shots with his feet set throughout his career, the evolution of which will play a big role in how he's perceived as an NBA prospect. He also has some multipositional versatility defensively with his length, strength and toughness. Livingston mostly played the 4 in high school but doesn't have great size for the position at 6-7, so it will be interesting to see how he's utilized at Kentucky and what that means for the Wildcats' offensive spacing. -- Jonathan Givony

  Livingston is a strong, physical wing that leverages his explosives and size to play a downhill game. He’s a real threat in transition when he’s got a head of steam and is nearly impossible to slow down.
Whether it’s on the break or in a half court set, Livingston likes to play above the rim. Even when he’s not throwing down a powerful dunk, he’s able to hang in the air long enough and use body control to finish tough layups.
When he’s not attacking the rim, Livingston does have the range to knock down triples. He’s shown he can convert on deep 3-pointers, but teams will be monitoring his shooting efficiency as the 3-point line moves back at the college level. He was reliable from deep as a freshman, but certainly not elite. 
If anyone has the body that’s ready for the NBA, Livingston is one of the top guys in this class. Later in his high school career he was able to bully smaller players, so it was interesting to see how he performed against more athletic players at the college level. To this point he’s been really effective drawing fouls, as defenders have to play him physical to combat the aggressive nature of Livingston’s game. He's even able to navigate in the post when needed.
Overall, the 6-foot-6 wing has the tools to be effective in any area on the court. He’s a good passer and willing facilitator. The Ohio native is also an advanced rebounder for his position and has a knack for finding the ball.
Defensively he has the combination of size, speed and strength to defend multiple positions. To be clear, Livingston still has work to do in order to become a better defender, but all of the intangibles are there. That will be promising for NBA teams.
Kentucky had high expectations this season, with Livingston having the pressure of being a high impact wing. He wasn't as productive as we had hoped, but he's a good enough prospect that declaring for the 2023 NBA Draft made sense. 
Luckily for him, playing under the bright lights isn’t a problem for Livingston. His senior season at Oak Hill, he played against some of the top players in the country and often outshined everyone in big moments. From there, he now has the experience playing in a tough conference with the Wildcats.
Livingston has a twin brother, Cordell, who played as his teammate growing up played at Kentucky State last season.
He’s not currently being talked about as a lottery talent, but there's a chance he ends up being one of the better players in this class when it's all said and done."
